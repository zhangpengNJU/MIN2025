 * <P>
 * The higher-level code that calls getCustomEditor may either embed
 * the Component in some larger property sheet, or it may put it in
 * its own individual dialog, or ...
 *
 * @return A java.awt.Component that will allow a human to directly
 *      edit the current property value.  May be null if this is
