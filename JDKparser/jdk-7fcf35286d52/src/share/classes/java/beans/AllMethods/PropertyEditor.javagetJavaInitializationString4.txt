/**
 * Returns a fragment of Java code that can be used to set a property
 * to match the editors current state. This method is intended
 * for use when generating Java code to reflect changes made through the
 * property editor.
 * <p>
 * The code fragment should be context free and must be a legal Java
 * expression as specified by the JLS.
 * <p>
 * Specifically, if the expression represents a computation then all
 * classes and static members should be fully qualified. This rule
 * applies to constructors, static methods and non primitive arguments.
 * <p>
 * Caution should be used when evaluating the expression as it may throw
 * exceptions. In particular, code generators must ensure that generated
 * code will compile in the presence of an expression that can throw
 * checked exceptions.
 * <p>
 * Example results are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Primitive expresssion: <code>2</code>
 * <li>Class constructor: <code>new java.awt.Color(127,127,34)</code>
 * <li>Static field: <code>java.awt.Color.orange</code>
 * <li>Static method: <code>javax.swing.Box.createRigidArea(new
 *                                   java.awt.Dimension(0, 5))</code>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @return a fragment of Java code representing an initializer for the
 *         current value. It should not contain a semi-colon
 *         ('<code>;</code>') to end the expression.
