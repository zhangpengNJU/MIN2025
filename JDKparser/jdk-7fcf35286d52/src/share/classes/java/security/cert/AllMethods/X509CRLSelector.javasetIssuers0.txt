 * Sets the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the

 * <p>
 * This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call,
 * the complete set of issuer names which {@code X509CRLs} may contain.
 * The specified value replaces the previous value for the issuerNames
 * criterion.
 * <p>
 * The {@code names} parameter (if not {@code null}) is a
 * {@code Collection} of {@code X500Principal}s.
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@code names} parameter can contain duplicate
 * distinguished names, but they may be removed from the
 * {@code Collection} of names returned by the
 * {@link #getIssuers getIssuers} method.
 * <p>
 * Note that a copy is performed on the {@code Collection} to
 * protect against subsequent modifications.
