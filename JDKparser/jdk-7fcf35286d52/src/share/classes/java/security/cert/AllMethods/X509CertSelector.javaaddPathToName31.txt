/**
 * Adds a name to the pathToNames criterion. The {@code X509Certificate}
 * must not include name constraints that would prohibit building a
 * path to the specified name.
 * <p>
 * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of names which
 * the {@code X509Certificates}'s name constraints must permit.
 * The specified name is added to any previous value for the
 * pathToNames criterion. If the name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.
 * <p>
 * The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
 * the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure
 * defined in RFC 5280 and X.509. The ASN.1 definition of this structure
 * appears in the documentation for
 * {@link #addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)
 * addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name)}.
 * <p>
 * Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
 * subsequent modifications.
 *
 * @param type the name type (0-8, as specified in
 *             RFC 5280, section 4.2.1.6)
 * @param name a byte array containing the name in ASN.1 DER encoded form
 * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs
