/**
 * Gets the certificate constraints path length from the
 * critical {@code BasicConstraints} extension, (OID = 2.5.29.19).
 * <p>
 * The basic constraints extension identifies whether the subject
 * of the certificate is a Certificate Authority (CA) and
 * how deep a certification path may exist through that CA. The
 * {@code pathLenConstraint} field (see below) is meaningful
 * only if {@code cA} is set to TRUE. In this case, it gives the
 * maximum number of CA certificates that may follow this certificate in a
 * certification path. A value of zero indicates that only an end-entity
 * certificate may follow in the path.
 * <p>
 * The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * BasicConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
 *     cA                  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
 *     pathLenConstraint   INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @return the value of {@code pathLenConstraint} if the
 * BasicConstraints extension is present in the certificate and the
 * subject of the certificate is a CA, otherwise -1.
 * If the subject of the certificate is a CA and
 * {@code pathLenConstraint} does not appear,
 * {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} is returned to indicate that there is no
 * limit to the allowed length of the certification path.
