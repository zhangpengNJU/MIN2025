/**
 * Gets a boolean array representing bits of
 * the {@code KeyUsage} extension, (OID = 2.5.29.15).
 * The key usage extension defines the purpose (e.g., encipherment,
 * signature, certificate signing) of the key contained in the
 * certificate.
 * The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * KeyUsage ::= BIT STRING {
 *     digitalSignature        (0),
 *     nonRepudiation          (1),
 *     keyEncipherment         (2),
 *     dataEncipherment        (3),
 *     keyAgreement            (4),
 *     keyCertSign             (5),
 *     cRLSign                 (6),
 *     encipherOnly            (7),
 *     decipherOnly            (8) }
 * </pre>
 * RFC 5280 recommends that when used, this be marked
 * as a critical extension.
 *
 * @return the KeyUsage extension of this certificate, represented as
 * an array of booleans. The order of KeyUsage values in the array is
 * the same as in the above ASN.1 definition. The array will contain a
 * value for each KeyUsage defined above. If the KeyUsage list encoded
 * in the certificate is longer than the above list, it will not be
 * truncated. Returns null if this certificate does not
 * contain a KeyUsage extension.
