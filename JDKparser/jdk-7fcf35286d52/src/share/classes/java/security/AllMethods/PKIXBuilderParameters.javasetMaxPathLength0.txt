/**
 * Sets the value of the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
 * certificates that may exist in a certification path. A certificate
 * is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer
 * fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate
 * in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not
 * included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity
 * certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX
 * {@code CertPathBuilder} instance must not build
 * paths longer than the length specified.
 *
 * <p> A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain
 * a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the
 * path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum).
 * The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5.
 * Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown.
 *
 * <p> If any of the CA certificates contain the
 * {@code BasicConstraintsExtension}, the value of the
 * {@code pathLenConstraint} field of the extension overrides
 * the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a
 * certification path of smaller length.
 *
 * @param maxPathLength the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
 *  certificates that may exist in a certification path
 * @throws InvalidParameterException if {@code maxPathLength} is set
 *  to a value less than -1
 *
 * @see #getMaxPathLength
