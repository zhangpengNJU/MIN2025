/**
 * Returns a copy of the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished
 * name in the {@code X509CRL} must match at least one of the specified
 * distinguished names. If the value returned is {@code null}, any
 * issuer distinguished name will do.
 * <p>
 * If the value returned is not {@code null}, it is a
 * {@code Collection} of names. Each name is a {@code String}
 * or a byte array representing a distinguished name (in RFC 2253 or
 * ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively).  Note that the
 * {@code Collection} returned may contain duplicate names.
 * <p>
 * If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER
 * encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for
 * this structure is given in the documentation for
 * {@link #setIssuerNames setIssuerNames(Collection names)}.
 * <p>
 * Note that a deep copy is performed on the {@code Collection} to
 * protect against subsequent modifications.
 *
 * @return a {@code Collection} of names (or {@code null})
 * @see #setIssuerNames
