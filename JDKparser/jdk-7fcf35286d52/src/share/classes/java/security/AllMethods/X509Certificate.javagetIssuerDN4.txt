/**
 * <strong>Denigrated</strong>, replaced by {@linkplain
 * #getIssuerX500Principal()}. This method returns the {@code issuer}
 * as an implementation specific Principal object, which should not be
 * relied upon by portable code.
 *
 * <p>
 * Gets the {@code issuer} (issuer distinguished name) value from
 * the certificate. The issuer name identifies the entity that signed (and
 * issued) the certificate.
 *
 * <p>The issuer name field contains an
 * X.500 distinguished name (DN).
 * The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * issuer    Name
 *
 * Name ::= CHOICE { RDNSequence }
 * RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName
 * RelativeDistinguishedName ::=
 *     SET OF AttributeValueAssertion
 *
 * AttributeValueAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
 *                               AttributeType,
 *                               AttributeValue }
 * AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER
 * AttributeValue ::= ANY
 * </pre>
 * The {@code Name} describes a hierarchical name composed of
 * attributes,
 * such as country name, and corresponding values, such as US.
 * The type of the {@code AttributeValue} component is determined by
 * the {@code AttributeType}; in general it will be a
 * {@code directoryString}. A {@code directoryString} is usually
 * one of {@code PrintableString},
 * {@code TeletexString} or {@code UniversalString}.
 *
 * @return a Principal whose name is the issuer distinguished name.
