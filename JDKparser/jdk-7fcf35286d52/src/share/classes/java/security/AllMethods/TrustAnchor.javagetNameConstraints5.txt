 * The name constraints are returned as a byte array. This byte array
 * contains the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
 * would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 5280
 * and X.509. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the
 * documentation for
 * {@link #TrustAnchor(X509Certificate, byte[])
 * TrustAnchor(X509Certificate trustedCert, byte[] nameConstraints) }.
 * <p>
 * Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against
 * subsequent modifications.
 *
 * @return a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
 *         a NameConstraints extension used for checking name constraints,
 *         or {@code null} if not set.
