/**
 * Gets a Set of the OID strings for the extension(s) marked
 * CRITICAL in the certificate/CRL managed by the object
 * implementing this interface.
 *
 * Here is sample code to get a Set of critical extensions from an
 * X509Certificate and print the OIDs:
 * <pre>{@code
 * X509Certificate cert = null;
 * try (InputStream inStrm = new FileInputStream("DER-encoded-Cert")) {
 *     CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
 *     cert = (X509Certificate)cf.generateCertificate(inStrm);
 * }
 *
 * Set<String> critSet = cert.getCriticalExtensionOIDs();
 * if (critSet != null && !critSet.isEmpty()) {
 *     System.out.println("Set of critical extensions:");
 *     for (String oid : critSet) {
 *         System.out.println(oid);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * @return a Set (or an empty Set if none are marked critical) of
 * the extension OID strings for extensions that are marked critical.
 * If there are no extensions present at all, then this method returns
 * null.
