/**
 * Creates a default <code>PreparedStatement</code> object that has
 * the capability to retrieve auto-generated keys. The given constant
 * tells the driver whether it should make auto-generated keys
 * available for retrieval.  This parameter is ignored if the SQL statement
 * is not an <code>INSERT</code> statement, or an SQL statement able to return
 * auto-generated keys (the list of such statements is vendor-specific).
 * <P>
 * <B>Note:</B> This method is optimized for handling
 * parametric SQL statements that benefit from precompilation. If
 * the driver supports precompilation,
 * the method <code>prepareStatement</code> will send
 * the statement to the database for precompilation. Some drivers
 * may not support precompilation. In this case, the statement may
 * not be sent to the database until the <code>PreparedStatement</code>
 * object is executed.  This has no direct effect on users; however, it does
 * affect which methods throw certain SQLExceptions.
 * <P>
 * Result sets created using the returned <code>PreparedStatement</code>
 * object will by default be type <code>TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY</code>
 * and have a concurrency level of <code>CONCUR_READ_ONLY</code>.
 * The holdability of the created result sets can be determined by
 * calling {@link #getHoldability}.
 *
 * @param sql an SQL statement that may contain one or more '?' IN
 *        parameter placeholders
 * @param autoGeneratedKeys a flag indicating whether auto-generated keys
 *        should be returned; one of
 *        <code>Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS</code> or
 *        <code>Statement.NO_GENERATED_KEYS</code>
 * @return a new <code>PreparedStatement</code> object, containing the
 *         pre-compiled SQL statement, that will have the capability of
 *         returning auto-generated keys
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs, this
 *  method is called on a closed connection
 *         or the given parameter is not a <code>Statement</code>
 *         constant indicating whether auto-generated keys should be
 *         returned
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method with a constant of Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS
 * @since 1.4
