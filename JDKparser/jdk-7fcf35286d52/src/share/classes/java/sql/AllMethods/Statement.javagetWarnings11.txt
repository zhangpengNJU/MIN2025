/**
 * Retrieves the first warning reported by calls on this <code>Statement</code> object.

 *
 * <p>The warning chain is automatically cleared each time
 * a statement is (re)executed. This method may not be called on a closed
 * <code>Statement</code> object; doing so will cause an <code>SQLException</code>
 * to be thrown.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> If you are processing a <code>ResultSet</code> object, any
 * warnings associated with reads on that <code>ResultSet</code> object
 * will be chained on it rather than on the <code>Statement</code>
 * object that produced it.
 *
 * @return the first <code>SQLWarning</code> object or <code>null</code>
 *         if there are no warnings
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs or
 * this method is called on a closed <code>Statement</code>
