/**
 * Refreshes the current row with its most recent value in
 * the database.  This method cannot be called when
 * the cursor is on the insert row.
 *
 * <P>The <code>refreshRow</code> method provides a way for an
 * application to
 * explicitly tell the JDBC driver to refetch a row(s) from the
 * database.  An application may want to call <code>refreshRow</code> when
 * caching or prefetching is being done by the JDBC driver to
 * fetch the latest value of a row from the database.  The JDBC driver
 * may actually refresh multiple rows at once if the fetch size is
 * greater than one.
 *
 * <P> All values are refetched subject to the transaction isolation
 * level and cursor sensitivity.  If <code>refreshRow</code> is called after
 * calling an updater method, but before calling
 * the method <code>updateRow</code>, then the
 * updates made to the row are lost.  Calling the method
 * <code>refreshRow</code> frequently will likely slow performance.
 *
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error
 * occurs; this method is called on a closed result set;
 * the result set type is <code>TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY</code> or if this
 * method is called when the cursor is on the insert row
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method or this method is not supported for the specified result
 * set type and result set concurrency.
