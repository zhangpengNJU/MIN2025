/**
 * Retrieves a stream that can be used to write to the <code>BLOB</code>
 * value that this <code>Blob</code> object represents.  The stream begins
 * at position <code>pos</code>.
 * The  bytes written to the stream will overwrite the existing bytes
 * in the <code>Blob</code> object starting at the position
 * <code>pos</code>.  If the end of the <code>Blob</code> value is reached
 * while writing to the stream, then the length of the <code>Blob</code>
 * value will be increased to accommodate the extra bytes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> If the value specified for <code>pos</code>
 * is greater then the length+1 of the <code>BLOB</code> value then the
 * behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a
 * <code>SQLException</code> while other drivers may support this
 * operation.
 *
 * @param pos the position in the <code>BLOB</code> value at which
 *        to start writing; the first position is 1
 * @return a <code>java.io.OutputStream</code> object to which data can
 *         be written
 * @exception SQLException if there is an error accessing the
 *            <code>BLOB</code> value or if pos is less than 1
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
