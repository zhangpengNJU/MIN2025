/**
 * Sets the value of the client info property specified by name to the
 * value specified by value.
 * <p>
 * Applications may use the <code>DatabaseMetaData.getClientInfoProperties</code>
 * method to determine the client info properties supported by the driver
 * and the maximum length that may be specified for each property.
 * <p>
 * The driver stores the value specified in a suitable location in the
 * database.  For example in a special register, session parameter, or
 * system table column.  For efficiency the driver may defer setting the
 * value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or
 * prepared.  Other than storing the client information in the appropriate
 * place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of
 * the connection in anyway.  The values supplied to these methods are
 * used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only.
 * <p>
 * The driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified
 * is not recognized by the driver.
 * <p>
 * If the value specified to this method is greater than the maximum
 * length for the property the driver may either truncate the value and
 * generate a warning or generate a <code>SQLClientInfoException</code>.  If the driver
 * generates a <code>SQLClientInfoException</code>, the value specified was not set on the
 * connection.
 * <p>
 * The following are standard client info properties.  Drivers are not
 * required to support these properties however if the driver supports a
 * client info property that can be described by one of the standard
 * properties, the standard property name should be used.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>ApplicationName  -       The name of the application currently utilizing
 *                                                      the connection</li>
 * <li>ClientUser               -       The name of the user that the application using
 *                                                      the connection is performing work for.  This may
 *                                                      not be the same as the user name that was used
 *                                                      in establishing the connection.</li>
 * <li>ClientHostname   -       The hostname of the computer the application
 *                                                      using the connection is running on.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * @param name          The name of the client info property to set
 * @param value         The value to set the client info property to.  If the
 *                                      value is null, the current value of the specified
 *                                      property is cleared.
 * <p>
 * @throws      SQLClientInfoException if the database server returns an error while
 *                      setting the client info value on the database server or this method
 * is called on a closed connection
