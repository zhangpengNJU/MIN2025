/**
 * Retrieves whether this <code>Connection</code> object has been

 * has been called on it or if certain fatal errors have occurred.
 * This method is guaranteed to return <code>true</code> only when
 * it is called after the method <code>Connection.close</code> has
 * been called.
 * <P>
 * This method generally cannot be called to determine whether a
 * connection to a database is valid or invalid.  A typical client
 * can determine that a connection is invalid by catching any
 * exceptions that might be thrown when an operation is attempted.
 *
 * @return <code>true</code> if this <code>Connection</code> object
 *         is closed; <code>false</code> if it is still open
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs
