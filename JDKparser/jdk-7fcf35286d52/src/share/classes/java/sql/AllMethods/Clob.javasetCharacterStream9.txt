/**
 * Retrieves a stream to be used to write a stream of Unicode characters
 * to the <code>CLOB</code> value that this <code>Clob</code> object
 * represents, at position <code>pos</code>. Characters written to the stream
 * will overwrite the existing characters
 * in the <code>Clob</code> object starting at the position
 * <code>pos</code>.  If the end of the <code>Clob</code> value is reached
 * while writing characters to the stream, then the length of the <code>Clob</code>
 * value will be increased to accommodate the extra characters.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> If the value specified for <code>pos</code>
 * is greater then the length+1 of the <code>CLOB</code> value then the
 * behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a
 * <code>SQLException</code> while other drivers may support this
 * operation.
 *
 * @param  pos the position at which to start writing to the
 *        <code>CLOB</code> value; The first position is 1
 *
 * @return a stream to which Unicode encoded characters can be written
 * @exception SQLException if there is an error accessing the
 *            <code>CLOB</code> value or if pos is less than 1
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
