/**
 * Updates the designated column with an ascii stream value.
 * The data will be read from the stream
 * as needed until end-of-stream is reached.
 * <p>
 * The updater methods are used to update column values in the
 * current row or the insert row.  The updater methods do not
 * update the underlying database; instead the <code>updateRow</code> or
 * <code>insertRow</code> methods are called to update the database.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
 * it might be more efficient to use a version of
 * <code>updateAsciiStream</code> which takes a length parameter.
 *
 * @param columnIndex the first column is 1, the second is 2, ...
 * @param x the new column value
 * @exception SQLException if the columnIndex is not valid;
 * if a database access error occurs;
 * the result set concurrency is <code>CONCUR_READ_ONLY</code>
 * or this method is called on a closed result set
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
