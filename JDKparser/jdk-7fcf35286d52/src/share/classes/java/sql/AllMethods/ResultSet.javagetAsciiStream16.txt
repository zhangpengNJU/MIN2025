/**
 * Retrieves the value of the designated column in the current row

 * a stream of ASCII characters. The value can then be read in chunks from the
 * stream. This method is particularly
 * suitable for retrieving large <code>LONGVARCHAR</code> values.
 * The JDBC driver will
 * do any necessary conversion from the database format into ASCII.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> All the data in the returned stream must be
 * read prior to getting the value of any other column. The next
 * call to a getter method implicitly closes the stream.  Also, a
 * stream may return <code>0</code> when the method
 * <code>InputStream.available</code>
 * is called whether there is data available or not.
 *
 * @param columnIndex the first column is 1, the second is 2, ...
 * @return a Java input stream that delivers the database column value
 * as a stream of one-byte ASCII characters;
 * if the value is SQL <code>NULL</code>, the
 * value returned is <code>null</code>
 * @exception SQLException if the columnIndex is not valid;
 * if a database access error occurs or this method is
 *            called on a closed result set
