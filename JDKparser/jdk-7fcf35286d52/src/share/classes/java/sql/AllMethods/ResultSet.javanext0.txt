/**
 * Moves the cursor forward one row from its current position.
 * A <code>ResultSet</code> cursor is initially positioned
 * before the first row; the first call to the method
 * <code>next</code> makes the first row the current row; the
 * second call makes the second row the current row, and so on.
 * <p>
 * When a call to the <code>next</code> method returns <code>false</code>,
 * the cursor is positioned after the last row. Any
 * invocation of a <code>ResultSet</code> method which requires a
 * current row will result in a <code>SQLException</code> being thrown.
 *  If the result set type is <code>TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY</code>, it is vendor specified
 * whether their JDBC driver implementation will return <code>false</code> or
 *  throw an <code>SQLException</code> on a
 * subsequent call to <code>next</code>.
 *
 * <P>If an input stream is open for the current row, a call
 * to the method <code>next</code> will
 * implicitly close it. A <code>ResultSet</code> object's
 * warning chain is cleared when a new row is read.
 *
 * @return <code>true</code> if the new current row is valid;
 * <code>false</code> if there are no more rows
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs or this method is
 *            called on a closed result set
