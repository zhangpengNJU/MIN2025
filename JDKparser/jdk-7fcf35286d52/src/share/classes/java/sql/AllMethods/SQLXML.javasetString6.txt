 * XML according to section 2 and appendix B of the XML 1.0 specification.
 * Although an encoding declaration other than unicode may be present,
 * the encoding of the String is unicode.
 * The behavior of this method is the same as ResultSet.updateString()
 * when the designated column of the ResultSet has a type java.sql.Types of SQLXML.
 * <p>
 * The SQL XML object becomes not writeable when this method is called and
 * may also become not readable depending on implementation.
 *
 * @param value the XML value
 * @throws SQLException if there is an error processing the XML value.
 *   The getCause() method of the exception may provide a more detailed exception, for example,
 *   if the stream does not contain valid characters.
 *   An exception is thrown if the state is not writable.
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
