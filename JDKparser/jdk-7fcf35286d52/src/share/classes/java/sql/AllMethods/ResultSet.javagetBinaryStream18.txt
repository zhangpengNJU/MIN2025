/**
 * Retrieves the value of the designated column in the current row

 * stream. This method is particularly
 * suitable for retrieving large <code>LONGVARBINARY</code> values.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> All the data in the returned stream must be
 * read prior to getting the value of any other column. The next
 * call to a getter method implicitly closes the stream.  Also, a
 * stream may return <code>0</code> when the method
 * <code>InputStream.available</code>
 * is called whether there is data available or not.

 * @return a Java input stream that delivers the database column value
 *         as a stream of uninterpreted bytes;
 *         if the value is SQL <code>NULL</code>, the value returned is
 *         <code>null</code>
 * @exception SQLException if the columnIndex is not valid;
 * if a database access error occurs or this method is
