/**
 * Produces a method handle giving write access to a non-static field.
 * The type of the method handle will have a void return type.
 * The method handle will take two arguments, the instance containing
 * the field, and the value to be stored.
 * The second argument will be of the field's value type.
 * Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
 * @param refc the class or interface from which the method is accessed
 * @param name the field's name
 * @param type the field's type
 * @return a method handle which can store values into the field
 * @throws NoSuchFieldException if the field does not exist
 * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails, or if the field is {@code static}
 * @exception SecurityException if a security manager is present and it
 *                              <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr">refuses access</a>
 * @throws NullPointerException if any argument is null
