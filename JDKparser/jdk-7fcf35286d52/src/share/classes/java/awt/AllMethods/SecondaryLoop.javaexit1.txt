 * Unblocks the execution of the thread blocked by the {@link

 * the {@link #enter} method was invoked.
 * <p>
 * Note that if any other secondary loop is started while this
 * loop is running, the blocked thread will not resume execution
 * until the nested loop is terminated.
 * <p>
 * If this secondary loop has not been started with the {@link
 * #enter} method, or this secondary loop has already finished
 * with the {@link #exit} method, this method returns {@code
 * false}, otherwise {@code true} is returned.
 *
 * @return {@code true} if this loop was previously started and
 *         has not yet been finished with the {@link #exit} method,
 *         {@code false} otherwise
