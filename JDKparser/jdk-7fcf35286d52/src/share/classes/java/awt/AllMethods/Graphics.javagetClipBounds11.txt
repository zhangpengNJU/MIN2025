/**
 * Returns the bounding rectangle of the current clipping area.
 * This method refers to the user clip, which is independent of the
 * clipping associated with device bounds and window visibility.
 * If no clip has previously been set, or if the clip has been
 * cleared using <code>setClip(null)</code>, this method returns
 * <code>null</code>.
 * The coordinates in the rectangle are relative to the coordinate
 * system origin of this graphics context.
 * @return      the bounding rectangle of the current clipping area,
 *              or <code>null</code> if no clip is set.
