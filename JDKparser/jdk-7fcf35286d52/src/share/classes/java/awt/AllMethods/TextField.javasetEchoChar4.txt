/**
 * Sets the echo character for this text field.
 * <p>
 * An echo character is useful for text fields where
 * user input should not be echoed to the screen, as in
 * the case of a text field for entering a password.
 * Setting <code>echoChar</code> = <code>0</code> allows
 * user input to be echoed to the screen again.
 * <p>
 * A Java platform implementation may support only a limited,
 * non-empty set of echo characters. Attempts to set an
 * unsupported echo character will cause the default echo
 * character to be used instead. Subsequent calls to getEchoChar()
 * will return the echo character originally requested. This might
 * or might not be identical to the echo character actually
 * used by the TextField implementation.
 * @param       c   the echo character for this text field.
 * @see         java.awt.TextField#echoCharIsSet
 * @see         java.awt.TextField#getEchoChar
 * @since       JDK1.1
