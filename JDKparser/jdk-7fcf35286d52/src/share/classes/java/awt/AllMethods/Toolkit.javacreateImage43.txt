/**
 * Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified URL.
 * The returned Image is a new object which will not be shared
 * with any other caller of this method or its getImage variant.
 * <p>
 * This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
 * If so, the method calls the security manager's
 * <code>checkPermission</code> method with the
 * url.openConnection().getPermission() permission to ensure
 * that the image creation is allowed. For compatibility
 * with pre-1.2 security managers, if the access is denied with
 * <code>FilePermission</code> or <code>SocketPermission</code>,
 * the method throws <code>SecurityException</code>
 * if the corresponding 1.1-style SecurityManager.checkXXX method
 * also denies permission.
 * @param     url   the URL to use in fetching the pixel data.
 * @return    an image which gets its pixel data from
 *                         the specified URL.
 * @throws SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
 *                            checkPermission method doesn't allow
 *                            the operation.
 * @see #getImage(java.net.URL)
