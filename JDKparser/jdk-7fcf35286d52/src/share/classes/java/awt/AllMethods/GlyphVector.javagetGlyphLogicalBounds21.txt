/**
 * Returns the logical bounds of the specified glyph within this
 * <code>GlyphVector</code>.
 * These logical bounds have a total of four edges, with two edges
 * parallel to the baseline under the glyph's transform and the other two
 * edges are shared with adjacent glyphs if they are present.  This
 * method is useful for hit-testing of the specified glyph,
 * positioning of a caret at the leading or trailing edge of a glyph,
 * and for drawing a highlight region around the specified glyph.
 * @param glyphIndex the index into this <code>GlyphVector</code>
 *   that corresponds to the glyph from which to retrieve its logical
 *   bounds
 * @return  a <code>Shape</code> that is the logical bounds of the
 *   glyph at the specified <code>glyphIndex</code>.
 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if <code>glyphIndex</code>
 *   is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number
 *   of glyphs in this <code>GlyphVector</code>
 * @see #getGlyphVisualBounds
