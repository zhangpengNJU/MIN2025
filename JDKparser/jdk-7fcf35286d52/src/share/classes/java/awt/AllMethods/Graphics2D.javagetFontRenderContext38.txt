/**
 * Get the rendering context of the <code>Font</code> within this
 * <code>Graphics2D</code> context.
 * The {@link FontRenderContext}
 * encapsulates application hints such as anti-aliasing and
 * fractional metrics, as well as target device specific information
 * such as dots-per-inch.  This information should be provided by the
 * application when using objects that perform typographical
 * formatting, such as <code>Font</code> and
 * <code>TextLayout</code>.  This information should also be provided
 * by applications that perform their own layout and need accurate
 * measurements of various characteristics of glyphs such as advance
 * and line height when various rendering hints have been applied to
 * the text rendering.
 *
 * @return a reference to an instance of FontRenderContext.
