/**
 * Attempts to select an input method or keyboard layout that
 * supports the given locale, and returns a value indicating whether such
 * an input method or keyboard layout has been successfully selected. The
 * following steps are taken until an input method has been selected:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If the currently selected input method or keyboard layout supports the
 * requested locale, it remains selected.</li>
 *
 * <li>
 * If there is no input method or keyboard layout available that supports
 * the requested locale, the current input method or keyboard layout remains
 * selected.</li>
 *
 * <li>
 * If the user has previously selected an input method or keyboard layout
 * for the requested locale from the user interface, then the most recently
 * selected such input method or keyboard layout is reselected.</li>
 *
 * <li>
 * Otherwise, an input method or keyboard layout that supports the requested
 * locale is selected in an implementation dependent way.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 * Before switching away from an input method, any currently uncommitted text
 * is committed. If no input method or keyboard layout supporting the requested
 * locale is available, then false is returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * Not all host operating systems provide API to determine the locale of
 * the currently selected native input method or keyboard layout, and to
 * select a native input method or keyboard layout by locale.
 * For host operating systems that don't provide such API,
 * <code>selectInputMethod</code> assumes that native input methods or
 * keyboard layouts provided by the host operating system support only the
 * system's default locale.
 *
 * <p>
 * A text editing component may call this method, for example, when
 * the user changes the insertion point, so that the user can
 * immediately continue typing in the language of the surrounding text.
 *
 * @param locale The desired new locale.
 * @return true if the input method or keyboard layout that's active after
 *         this call supports the desired locale.
 * @exception NullPointerException if <code>locale</code> is null
