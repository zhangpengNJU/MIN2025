 * methods to request additional information required for the

 * sequence of <code>InputMethodEvent</code>s. If the given text
 * cannot be reconverted, the same text should be sent to the
 * client component as committed text.

 * {@link java.awt.im.InputContext#reconvert() InputContext.reconvert}.

 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the input method does not
