/**
 * If this Window is visible, sends this Window to the back and may cause
 * it to lose focus or activation if it is the focused or active Window.
 * <p>
 * Places this Window at the bottom of the stacking order and shows it
 * behind any other Windows in this VM. No action will take place is this
 * Window is not visible. Some platforms do not allow Windows which are
 * owned by other Windows to appear below their owners. Every attempt will
 * be made to move this Window as low as possible in the stacking order;
 * however, developers should not assume that this method will move this
 * Window below all other windows in every situation.
 * <p>
 * Because of variations in native windowing systems, no guarantees about
 * changes to the focused and active Windows can be made. Developers must
 * never assume that this Window is no longer the focused or active Window
 * until this Window receives a WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS or WINDOW_DEACTIVATED
 * event. On platforms where the top-most window is the focused window,
 * this method will <b>probably</b> cause this Window to lose focus. In
 * that case, the next highest, focusable Window in this VM will receive
 * focus. On platforms where the stacking order does not typically affect
 * the focused window, this method will <b>probably</b> leave the focused
 * and active Windows unchanged.
