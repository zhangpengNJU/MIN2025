/**
 * Maps the operation's output RenderContext into a RenderContext
 * for each of the operation's sources.  This is useful for
 * operations that can be expressed in whole or in part simply as
 * alterations in the RenderContext, such as an affine mapping, or
 * operations that wish to obtain lower quality renderings of
 * their sources in order to save processing effort or
 * transmission bandwith.  Some operations, such as blur, can also
 * use this mechanism to avoid obtaining sources of higher quality
 * than necessary.
 *
 * @param i the index of the source image.
 * @param renderContext the RenderContext being applied to the operation.
 * @param paramBlock a ParameterBlock containing the operation's
 *        sources and parameters.
 * @param image the RenderableImage being rendered.
 * @return a <code>RenderContext</code> for
 *         the source at the specified index of the parameters
 *         Vector contained in the specified ParameterBlock.
