/**
 * Returns information about the caret corresponding to <code>hit</code>.
 * The first element of the array is the intersection of the caret with
 * the baseline, as a distance along the baseline. The second element
 * of the array is the inverse slope (run/rise) of the caret, measured
 * with respect to the baseline at that point.
 * <p>
 * This method is meant for informational use.  To display carets, it
 * is better to use <code>getCaretShapes</code>.
 * @param hit a hit on a character in this <code>TextLayout</code>
 * @param bounds the bounds to which the caret info is constructed.
 *     The bounds is in baseline-relative coordinates.
 * @return a two-element array containing the position and slope of
 * the caret.  The returned caret info is in baseline-relative coordinates.
