 * Sets the current focus cycle root. If the focus owner is itself a focus

 * the next and previous Components to focus during normal focus traversal.
 * In that case, the current focus cycle root is used to differentiate
 * among the possibilities.
 * <p>
 * If a SecurityManager is installed, the calling thread must be granted
 * the "replaceKeyboardFocusManager" AWTPermission. If this permission is
 * not granted, this method will throw a SecurityException, and the current
 * focus cycle root will not be changed.
 * <p>
 * This method is intended to be used only by KeyboardFocusManagers and
 * focus implementations. It is not for general client use.
