/**
 * Returns the character indices of the specified glyphs.
 * The character index is the index of the first logical
 * character represented by the glyph.  Indices are returned
 * in glyph order.  The default implementation invokes
 * getGlyphCharIndex for each glyph, and subclassers will probably
 * want to override this implementation for performance reasons.
 * Use this method for convenience and performance
 * in processing of glyphcodes. If no array is passed in,
 * a new array is created.
 * @param beginGlyphIndex the index of the first glyph
 * @param numEntries the number of glyph indices
 * @param codeReturn the array into which to return the character indices
 * @return an array of character indices, one per glyph.
 * @since 1.4
