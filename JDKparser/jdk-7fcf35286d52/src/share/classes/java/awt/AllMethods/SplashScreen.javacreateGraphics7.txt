 * on the overlay image does not necessarily update the contents of splash
 * screen window. You should call {@code update()} on the
 * <code>SplashScreen</code> when you want the splash screen to be
 * updated immediately.
 * <p>
 * The pixel (0, 0) in the coordinate space of the graphics context
 * corresponds to the origin of the splash screen native window bounds (see
