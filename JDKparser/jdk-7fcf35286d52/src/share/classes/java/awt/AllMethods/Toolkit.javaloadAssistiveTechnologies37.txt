/**
 * Loads additional classes into the VM, using the property
 * 'assistive_technologies' specified in the Sun reference
 * implementation by a line in the 'accessibility.properties'
 * file.  The form is "assistive_technologies=..." where
 * the "..." is a comma-separated list of assistive technology
 * classes to load.  Each class is loaded in the order given
 * and a single instance of each is created using
 * Class.forName(class).newInstance().  All errors are handled
 * via an AWTError exception.
 *
 * <p>The assumption is made that assistive technology classes are supplied
 * as part of INSTALLED (as opposed to: BUNDLED) extensions or specified
 * on the class path
 * (and therefore can be loaded using the class loader returned by
 * a call to <code>ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader</code>, whose
 * delegation parent is the extension class loader for installed
 * extensions).
