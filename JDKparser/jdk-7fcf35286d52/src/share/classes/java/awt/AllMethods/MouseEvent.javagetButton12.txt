/**
 * Returns which, if any, of the mouse buttons has changed state.
 * The returned value is ranged
 * from 0 to the {@link java.awt.MouseInfo#getNumberOfButtons() MouseInfo.getNumberOfButtons()}
 * value.
 * The returned value includes at least the following constants:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@code NOBUTTON}
 * <li> {@code BUTTON1}
 * <li> {@code BUTTON2}
 * <li> {@code BUTTON3}
 * </ul>
 * It is allowed to use those constants to compare with the returned button number in the application.
 * For example,
 * <pre>
 * if (anEvent.getButton() == MouseEvent.BUTTON1) {
 * </pre>
 * In particular, for a mouse with one, two, or three buttons this method may return the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li> 0 ({@code NOBUTTON})
 * <li> 1 ({@code BUTTON1})
 * <li> 2 ({@code BUTTON2})
 * <li> 3 ({@code BUTTON3})
 * </ul>
 * Button numbers greater then {@code BUTTON3} have no constant identifier. So if a mouse with five buttons is
 * installed, this method may return the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li> 0 ({@code NOBUTTON})
 * <li> 1 ({@code BUTTON1})
 * <li> 2 ({@code BUTTON2})
 * <li> 3 ({@code BUTTON3})
 * <li> 4
 * <li> 5
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note: If support for extended mouse buttons is {@link Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled() disabled} by Java
 * then the AWT event subsystem does not produce mouse events for the extended mouse
 * buttons. So it is not expected that this method returns anything except {@code NOBUTTON}, {@code BUTTON1},
 * {@code BUTTON2}, {@code BUTTON3}.
 *
 * @return one of the values from 0 to {@link java.awt.MouseInfo#getNumberOfButtons() MouseInfo.getNumberOfButtons()}
 *         if support for the extended mouse buttons is {@link Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled() enabled} by Java.
 *         That range includes {@code NOBUTTON}, {@code BUTTON1}, {@code BUTTON2}, {@code BUTTON3};
 *         <br>
 *         {@code NOBUTTON}, {@code BUTTON1}, {@code BUTTON2} or {@code BUTTON3}
 *         if support for the extended mouse buttons is {@link Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled() disabled} by Java
