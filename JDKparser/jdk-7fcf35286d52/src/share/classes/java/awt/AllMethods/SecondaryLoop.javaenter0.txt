/**
 * Blocks the execution of the current thread and enters a new
 * secondary event loop on the event dispatch thread.
 * <p>
 * This method can be called by any thread including the event
 * dispatch thread. This thread will be blocked until the {@link
 * #exit} method is called or the loop is terminated. A new
 * secondary loop will be created on the event dispatch thread
 * for dispatching events in either case.
 * <p>
 * This method can only start one new event loop at a time per
 * object. If a secondary event loop has already been started
 * by this object and is currently still running, this method
 * returns {@code false} to indicate that it was not successful
 * in starting a new event loop. Otherwise, this method blocks
 * the calling thread and later returns {@code true} when the
 * new event loop is terminated. At such time, this object can
 * again be used to start another new event loop.
 *
 * @return {@code true} after termination of the secondary loop,
 *         if the secondary loop was started by this call,
 *         {@code false} otherwise
