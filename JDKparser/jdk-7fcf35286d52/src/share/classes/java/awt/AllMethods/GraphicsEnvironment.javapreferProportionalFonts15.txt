/**
 * Indicates a preference for proportional over non-proportional (e.g.
 * dual-spaced CJK fonts) fonts in the mapping of logical fonts to
 * physical fonts. If the default mapping contains fonts for which
 * proportional and non-proportional variants exist, then calling
 * this method indicates the mapping should use a proportional variant.
 * <p>
 * The actual change in font rendering behavior resulting from a call to
 * this method is implementation dependent; it may have no effect at all.
 * The behavior may differ between font rendering in lightweight and
 * peered components. Since calling this method requests a
 * different font, clients should expect different metrics, and may need
 * to recalculate window sizes and layout. Therefore this method should
 * be called before user interface initialisation.
