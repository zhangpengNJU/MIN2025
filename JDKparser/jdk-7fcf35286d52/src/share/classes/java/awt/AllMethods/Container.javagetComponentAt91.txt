/**

 * the component closest to the index 0 that claims to contain
 * the given point via Component.contains(), except that Components
 * which have native peers take precedence over those which do not
 * (i.e., lightweight Components).
 *
 * @param x the <i>x</i> coordinate
 * @param y the <i>y</i> coordinate
 * @return null if the component does not contain the position.
 * If there is no child component at the requested point and the
 * point is within the bounds of the container the container itself
 * is returned; otherwise the top-most child is returned.
