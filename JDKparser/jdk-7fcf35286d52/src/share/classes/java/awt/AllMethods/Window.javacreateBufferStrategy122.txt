/**
 * Creates a new strategy for multi-buffering on this component.
 * Multi-buffering is useful for rendering performance.  This method
 * attempts to create the best strategy available with the number of
 * buffers supplied.  It will always create a {@code BufferStrategy}
 * with that number of buffers.
 * A page-flipping strategy is attempted first, then a blitting strategy
 * using accelerated buffers.  Finally, an unaccelerated blitting
 * strategy is used.
 * <p>
 * Each time this method is called,
 * the existing buffer strategy for this component is discarded.
 * @param numBuffers number of buffers to create
 * @exception IllegalArgumentException if numBuffers is less than 1.
 * @exception IllegalStateException if the component is not displayable
