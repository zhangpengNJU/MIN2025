/**
 * Sets the paint mode of this graphics context to alternate between
 * this graphics context's current color and the new specified color.
 * This specifies that logical pixel operations are performed in the
 * XOR mode, which alternates pixels between the current color and
 * a specified XOR color.
 * <p>
 * When drawing operations are performed, pixels which are the
 * current color are changed to the specified color, and vice versa.
 * <p>
 * Pixels that are of colors other than those two colors are changed
 * in an unpredictable but reversible manner; if the same figure is
 * drawn twice, then all pixels are restored to their original values.
 * @param     c1 the XOR alternation color
