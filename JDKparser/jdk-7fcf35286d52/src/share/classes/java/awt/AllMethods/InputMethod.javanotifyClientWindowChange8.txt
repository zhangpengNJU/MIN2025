 * method is the current input method of its input context and
 * notifications for it are enabled (see {@link

 * InputMethodContext.enableClientWindowNotification}). Calls
 * to this method are temporarily suspended if the input context's

 * method is called, and resume when the input method is activated
 * for a new client component. It is called in the following
 * situations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * when the window containing the current client component changes
 * in location, size, visibility, iconification state, or when the
 * window is closed.</li>
 * <li>
 * from <code> enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod,
 * true)</code> if the current client component exists,</li>
 * <li>
 * when activating the input method for the first time after it
 * called
 * <code>enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod,
 * true)</code> if during the call no current client component was
 * available,</li>
 * <li>
 * when activating the input method for a new client component
 * after the input context's removeNotify method has been
 * called.</li>
 * </ul>
