/**
 * Returns the focus owner, even if the calling thread is in a different
 * context than the focus owner. The focus owner is defined as the
 * Component in an application that will typically receive all KeyEvents
 * generated by the user. KeyEvents which map to the focus owner's focus
 * traversal keys will not be delivered if focus traversal keys are enabled
 * for the focus owner. In addition, KeyEventDispatchers may retarget or
 * consume KeyEvents before they reach the focus owner.
 * <p>
 * This method will throw a SecurityException if this KeyboardFocusManager
 * is not the current KeyboardFocusManager for the calling thread's
 * context.
 *
 * @return the focus owner
 * @see #getFocusOwner

 * @throws SecurityException if this KeyboardFocusManager is not the
 *         current KeyboardFocusManager for the calling thread's context
 *         and if the calling thread does not have "replaceKeyboardFocusManager"
