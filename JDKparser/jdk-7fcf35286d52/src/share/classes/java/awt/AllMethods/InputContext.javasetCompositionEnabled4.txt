/**
 * Enables or disables the current input method for composition,
 * depending on the value of the parameter <code>enable</code>.
 * <p>
 * An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming
 * events for both composition and control purposes, while a
 * disabled input method does not interpret events for composition.
 * Note however that events are passed on to the input method regardless
 * whether it is enabled or not, and that an input method that is disabled
 * for composition may still interpret events for control purposes,
 * including to enable or disable itself for composition.
 * <p>
 * For input methods provided by host operating systems, it is not always possible to
 * determine whether this operation is supported. For example, an input method may enable
 * composition only for some locales, and do nothing for other locales. For such input
 * methods, it is possible that this method does not throw
 * {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationException},
 * but also does not affect whether composition is enabled.
 *
 * @param enable whether to enable the current input method for composition
 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if there is no current input
 * method available or the current input method does not support
 * the enabling/disabling operation
 * @see #isCompositionEnabled
