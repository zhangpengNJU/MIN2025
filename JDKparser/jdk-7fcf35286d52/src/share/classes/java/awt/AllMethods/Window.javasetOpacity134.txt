/**
 * Sets the opacity of the window.
 * <p>
 * The opacity value is in the range [0..1]. Note that setting the opacity
 * level of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this
 * window. This is a platform-dependent behavior.
 * <p>
 * The following conditions must be met in order to set the opacity value
 * less than {@code 1.0f}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency#TRANSLUCENT TRANSLUCENT}
 * translucency must be supported by the underlying system
 * <li>The window must be undecorated (see {@link Frame#setUndecorated}
 * and {@link Dialog#setUndecorated})
 * <li>The window must not be in full-screen mode (see {@link
 * GraphicsDevice#setFullScreenWindow(Window)})
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the requested opacity value is less than {@code 1.0f}, and any of the
 * above conditions are not met, the window opacity will not change,
 * and the {@code IllegalComponentStateException} will be thrown.
 * <p>
 * The translucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the
 * alpha component of their color (see {@link Window#setBackground(Color)}) and the
 * current shape of this window (see {@link #setShape(Shape)}).
 *
 * @param opacity the opacity level to set to the window
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the opacity is out of the range
 *     [0..1]
 * @throws IllegalComponentStateException if the window is decorated and
 *     the opacity is less than {@code 1.0f}
 * @throws IllegalComponentStateException if the window is in full screen
 *     mode, and the opacity is less than {@code 1.0f}
 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the {@code
 *     GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency#TRANSLUCENT TRANSLUCENT}
 *     translucency is not supported and the opacity is less than
 *     {@code 1.0f}
