 * This method first checks if there is a security manager installed.
 * If so, the method calls the security manager's
 * <code>checkRead</code> method with the specified file to ensure
 * that the image creation is allowed.
 * @param     filename   the name of a file containing pixel data
 *                         in a recognized file format.
 * @return    an image which gets its pixel data from
 *                         the specified file.
 * @throws SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
 *                            checkRead method doesn't allow the operation.
