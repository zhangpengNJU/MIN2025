/**
 * Returns a <code>AffineTransform</code> that can be concatenated
 * with the default <code>AffineTransform</code>
 * of a <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code> so that 72 units in user
 * space equals 1 inch in device space.
 * <p>
 * For a particular {@link Graphics2D}, g, one
 * can reset the transformation to create
 * such a mapping by using the following pseudocode:
 * <pre>
 *      GraphicsConfiguration gc = g.getDeviceConfiguration();
 *
 *      g.setTransform(gc.getDefaultTransform());
 *      g.transform(gc.getNormalizingTransform());
 * </pre>
 * Note that sometimes this <code>AffineTransform</code> is identity,
 * such as for printers or metafile output, and that this
 * <code>AffineTransform</code> is only as accurate as the information
 * supplied by the underlying system.  For image buffers not
 * associated with a device, such as those not created by
 * <code>createCompatibleImage</code>, this
 * <code>AffineTransform</code> is the Identity transform
 * since there is no valid distance measurement.
 * @return an <code>AffineTransform</code> to concatenate to the
 * default <code>AffineTransform</code> so that 72 units in user
 * space is mapped to 1 inch in device space.
