/**
 * Sets the maximized bounds for this frame.
 * <p>
 * When a frame is in maximized state the system supplies some
 * defaults bounds.  This method allows some or all of those
 * system supplied values to be overridden.
 * <p>
 * If <code>bounds</code> is <code>null</code>, accept bounds
 * supplied by the system.  If non-<code>null</code> you can
 * override some of the system supplied values while accepting
 * others by setting those fields you want to accept from system
 * to <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>.
 * <p>
 * Note, the given maximized bounds are used as a hint for the native
 * system, because the underlying platform may not support setting the
 * location and/or size of the maximized windows.  If that is the case, the
 * provided values do not affect the appearance of the frame in the
 * maximized state.
 *
 * @param bounds  bounds for the maximized state
 * @see #getMaximizedBounds()
 * @since 1.4
