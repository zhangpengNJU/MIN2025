/**
 * Concatenates the current <code>Graphics2D</code>
 * <code>Transform</code> with a rotation transform.
 * Subsequent rendering is rotated by the specified radians relative
 * to the previous origin.
 * This is equivalent to calling <code>transform(R)</code>, where R is an
 * <code>AffineTransform</code> represented by the following matrix:
 * <pre>
 *          [   cos(theta)    -sin(theta)    0   ]
 *          [   sin(theta)     cos(theta)    0   ]
 *          [       0              0         1   ]
 * </pre>
 * Rotating with a positive angle theta rotates points on the positive
 * x axis toward the positive y axis.
 * @param theta the angle of rotation in radians
