/**
 * Returns the default {@link AffineTransform} for this
 * <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code>. This
 * <code>AffineTransform</code> is typically the Identity transform
 * for most normal screens.  The default <code>AffineTransform</code>
 * maps coordinates onto the device such that 72 user space
 * coordinate units measure approximately 1 inch in device
 * space.  The normalizing transform can be used to make
 * this mapping more exact.  Coordinates in the coordinate space
 * defined by the default <code>AffineTransform</code> for screen and
 * printer devices have the origin in the upper left-hand corner of
 * the target region of the device, with X coordinates
 * increasing to the right and Y coordinates increasing downwards.
 * For image buffers not associated with a device, such as those not
 * created by <code>createCompatibleImage</code>,
 * this <code>AffineTransform</code> is the Identity transform.
 * @return the default <code>AffineTransform</code> for this
 * <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code>.
