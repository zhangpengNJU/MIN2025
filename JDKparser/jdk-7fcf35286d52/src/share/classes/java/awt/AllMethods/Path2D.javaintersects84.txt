/**
 * Tests if the interior of the specified {@link PathIterator}
 * intersects the interior of a specified {@link Rectangle2D}.
 * <p>
 * This method provides a basic facility for implementors of
 * the {@link Shape} interface to implement support for the
 * {@link Shape#intersects(Rectangle2D)} method.
 * <p>
 * This method object may conservatively return true in
 * cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a
 * segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a
 * boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
 * Such a case may occur if some set of segments of the
 * path are retraced in the reverse direction such that the
 * two sets of segments cancel each other out without any
 * interior area between them.
 * To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
 * the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
 * involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
 * rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.
 *
 * @param pi the specified {@code PathIterator}
 * @param r the specified {@code Rectangle2D}
 * @return {@code true} if the specified {@code PathIterator} and
 *         the interior of the specified {@code Rectangle2D}
 *         intersect each other; {@code false} otherwise.
 * @since 1.6
