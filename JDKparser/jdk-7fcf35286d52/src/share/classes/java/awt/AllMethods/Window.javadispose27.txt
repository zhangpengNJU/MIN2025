 * OS, and they will be marked as undisplayable.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Window} and its subcomponents can be made displayable
 * again by rebuilding the native resources with a subsequent call to
 * {@code pack} or {@code show}. The states of the recreated
 * {@code Window} and its subcomponents will be identical to the
 * states of these objects at the point where the {@code Window}
 * was disposed (not accounting for additional modifications between
 * those actions).
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>: When the last displayable window
 * within the Java virtual machine (VM) is disposed of, the VM may
 * terminate.  See <a href="doc-files/AWTThreadIssues.html#Autoshutdown">
 * AWT Threading Issues</a> for more information.
