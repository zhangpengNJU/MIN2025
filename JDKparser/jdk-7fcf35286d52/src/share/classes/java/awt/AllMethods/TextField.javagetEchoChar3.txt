/**
 * Gets the character that is to be used for echoing.
 * <p>
 * An echo character is useful for text fields where
 * user input should not be echoed to the screen, as in
 * the case of a text field for entering a password.
 * If <code>echoChar</code> = <code>0</code>, user
 * input is echoed to the screen unchanged.
 * <p>
 * A Java platform implementation may support only a limited,
 * non-empty set of echo characters. This function returns the
 * echo character originally requested via setEchoChar(). The echo
 * character actually used by the TextField implementation might be
 * different.
 * @return      the echo character for this text field.
 * @see         java.awt.TextField#echoCharIsSet
 * @see         java.awt.TextField#setEchoChar
