/**
 * Resets this <code>Polygon</code> object to an empty polygon.
 * The coordinate arrays and the data in them are left untouched
 * but the number of points is reset to zero to mark the old
 * vertex data as invalid and to start accumulating new vertex
 * data at the beginning.
 * All internally-cached data relating to the old vertices
 * are discarded.
 * Note that since the coordinate arrays from before the reset
 * are reused, creating a new empty <code>Polygon</code> might
 * be more memory efficient than resetting the current one if
 * the number of vertices in the new polygon data is significantly
 * smaller than the number of vertices in the data from before the
 * reset.
 * @see         java.awt.Polygon#invalidate
