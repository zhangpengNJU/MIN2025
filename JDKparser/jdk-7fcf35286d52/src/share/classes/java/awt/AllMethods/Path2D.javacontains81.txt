 * boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
 * Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
 * path if they are part of a path with a {@link #WIND_NON_ZERO}
 * winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse
 * direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each
 * other out without any exterior area falling between them.
 * To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
 * the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
 * involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
 * rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.
