/**
 * Move or rename a file to a target file. This method works in exactly the
 * manner specified by the {@link Files#move} method except that both the
 * source and target paths must be associated with this provider.
 *
 * @param   source
 *          the path to the file to move
 * @param   target
 *          the path to the target file
 * @param   options
 *          options specifying how the move should be done
 *
 * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
 *          if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
 * @throws  FileAlreadyExistsException
 *          if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the
 *          {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is not specified <i>(optional
 *          specific exception)</i>
 * @throws  DirectoryNotEmptyException
 *          the {@code REPLACE_EXISTING} option is specified but the file
 *          cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory
 *          <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
 * @throws  AtomicMoveNotSupportedException
 *          if the options array contains the {@code ATOMIC_MOVE} option but

 * @throws  IOException
 *          if an I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
 *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
 *          method is invoked to check write access to both the source and
