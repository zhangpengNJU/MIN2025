/**
 * Tests if this path ends with the given path.
 *
 * <p> If the given path has <em>N</em> elements, and no root component,
 * and this path has <em>N</em> or more elements, then this path ends with
 * the given path if the last <em>N</em> elements of each path, starting at
 * the element farthest from the root, are equal.
 *
 * <p> If the given path has a root component then this path ends with the
 * given path if the root component of this path <em>ends with</em> the root
 * component of the given path, and the corresponding elements of both paths
 * are equal. Whether or not the root component of this path ends with the
 * root component of the given path is file system specific. If this path
 * does not have a root component and the given path has a root component
 * then this path does not end with the given path.
 *
 * <p> If the given path is associated with a different {@code FileSystem}
 * to this path then {@code false} is returned.
 *
 * @param   other
 *          the given path
 *
 * @return  {@code true} if this path ends with the given path; otherwise
