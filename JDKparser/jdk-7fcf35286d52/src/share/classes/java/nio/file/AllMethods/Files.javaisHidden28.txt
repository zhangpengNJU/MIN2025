/**
 * Tells whether or not a file is considered <em>hidden</em>. The exact
 * definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent. On UNIX for
 * example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a
 * period character ('.'). On Windows a file is considered hidden if it
 * isn't a directory and the DOS {@link DosFileAttributes#isHidden hidden}
 * attribute is set.
 *
 * <p> Depending on the implementation this method may require to access
 * the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.
 *
 * @param   path
 *          the path to the file to test
 *
 * @return  {@code true} if the file is considered hidden
 *
 * @throws  IOException
 *          if an I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
 *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String) checkRead}
 *          method is invoked to check read access to the file.
