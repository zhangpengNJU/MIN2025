 * Tests if this path starts with the given path.

 * <p> This path <em>starts</em> with the given path if this path's root
 * component <em>starts</em> with the root component of the given path,
 * and this path starts with the same name elements as the given path.
 * If the given path has more name elements than this path then {@code false}
 * is returned.
 *
 * <p> Whether or not the root component of this path starts with the root
 * component of the given path is file system specific. If this path does
 * not have a root component and the given path has a root component then
 * this path does not start with the given path.
 *
 * <p> If the given path is associated with a different {@code FileSystem}
 * to this path then {@code false} is returned.

 *          the given path
 *
 * @return  {@code true} if this path starts with the given path; otherwise
