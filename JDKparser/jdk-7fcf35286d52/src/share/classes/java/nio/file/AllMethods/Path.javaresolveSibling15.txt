/**
 * Resolves the given path against this path's {@link #getParent parent}
 * path. This is useful where a file name needs to be <i>replaced</i> with
 * another file name. For example, suppose that the name separator is
 * "{@code /}" and a path represents "{@code dir1/dir2/foo}", then invoking
 * this method with the {@code Path} "{@code bar}" will result in the {@code
 * Path} "{@code dir1/dir2/bar}". If this path does not have a parent path,
 * or {@code other} is {@link #isAbsolute() absolute}, then this method
 * returns {@code other}. If {@code other} is an empty path then this method
 * returns this path's parent, or where this path doesn't have a parent, the
 * empty path.
 *
 * @param   other
 *          the path to resolve against this path's parent
 *
 * @return  the resulting path
 *
 * @see #resolve(Path)
