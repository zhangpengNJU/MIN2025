/**
 * Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer,
 * starting at the given file position.
 *
 * <p> This method initiates the reading of a sequence of bytes from this
 * channel into the given buffer, starting at the given file position. The
 * result of the read is the number of bytes read or {@code -1} if the given
 * position is greater than or equal to the file's size at the time that the
 * read is attempted.
 *
 * <p> This method works in the same manner as the {@link
 * AsynchronousByteChannel#read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)}
 * method, except that bytes are read starting at the given file position.
 * If the given file position is greater than the file's size at the time
 * that the read is attempted then no bytes are read.
 *
 * @param   <A>
 *          The type of the attachment
 * @param   dst
 *          The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
 * @param   position
 *          The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
 *          must be non-negative
 * @param   attachment
 *          The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be {@code null}
 * @param   handler
 *          The handler for consuming the result
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the position is negative or the buffer is read-only
 * @throws  NonReadableChannelException
 *          If this channel was not opened for reading
