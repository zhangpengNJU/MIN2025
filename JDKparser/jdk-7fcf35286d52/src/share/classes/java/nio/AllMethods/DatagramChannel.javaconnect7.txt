/**
 * Connects this channel's socket.
 *
 * <p> The channel's socket is configured so that it only receives
 * datagrams from, and sends datagrams to, the given remote <i>peer</i>
 * address.  Once connected, datagrams may not be received from or sent to
 * any other address.  A datagram socket remains connected until it is
 * explicitly disconnected or until it is closed.
 *
 * <p> This method performs exactly the same security checks as the {@link
 * java.net.DatagramSocket#connect connect} method of the {@link
 * java.net.DatagramSocket} class.  That is, if a security manager has been
 * installed then this method verifies that its {@link
 * java.lang.SecurityManager#checkAccept checkAccept} and {@link
 * java.lang.SecurityManager#checkConnect checkConnect} methods permit
 * datagrams to be received from and sent to, respectively, the given
 * remote address.
 *
 * <p> This method may be invoked at any time.  It will not have any effect
 * on read or write operations that are already in progress at the moment
 * that it is invoked. If this channel's socket is not bound then this method
 * will first cause the socket to be bound to an address that is assigned
 * automatically, as if invoking the {@link #bind bind} method with a
 * parameter of {@code null}. </p>
 *
 * @param  remote
 *         The remote address to which this channel is to be connected
 *
 * @return  This datagram channel
 *
 * @throws  ClosedChannelException
 *          If this channel is closed
 *
 * @throws  AsynchronousCloseException
 *          If another thread closes this channel
 *          while the connect operation is in progress
 *
 * @throws  ClosedByInterruptException
 *          If another thread interrupts the current thread
 *          while the connect operation is in progress, thereby
 *          closing the channel and setting the current thread's
 *          interrupt status
 *
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager has been installed
 *          and it does not permit access to the given remote address
 *
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If some other I/O error occurs
