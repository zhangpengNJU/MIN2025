 * returns a {@code Future} representing the pending result. The {@code
 * Future}'s {@link Future#get() get} method returns the {@link
 * AsynchronousSocketChannel} to the new connection on successful completion.
 *
 * @return  a {@code Future} object representing the pending result
 *
 * @throws  AcceptPendingException
 *          If an accept operation is already in progress on this channel
 * @throws  NotYetBoundException
 *          If this channel's socket has not yet been bound
