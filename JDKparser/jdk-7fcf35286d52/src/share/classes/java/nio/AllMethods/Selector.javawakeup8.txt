/**
 * Causes the first selection operation that has not yet returned to return
 * immediately.
 *
 * <p> If another thread is currently blocked in an invocation of the
 * {@link #select()} or {@link #select(long)} methods then that invocation
 * will return immediately.  If no selection operation is currently in
 * progress then the next invocation of one of these methods will return
 * immediately unless the {@link #selectNow()} method is invoked in the
 * meantime.  In any case the value returned by that invocation may be
 * non-zero.  Subsequent invocations of the {@link #select()} or {@link
 * #select(long)} methods will block as usual unless this method is invoked
 * again in the meantime.
 *
 * <p> Invoking this method more than once between two successive selection
 * operations has the same effect as invoking it just once.  </p>
