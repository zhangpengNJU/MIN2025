/**
 * Tells whether or not this charset contains the given charset.
 *
 * <p> A charset <i>C</i> is said to <i>contain</i> a charset <i>D</i> if,
 * and only if, every character representable in <i>D</i> is also
 * representable in <i>C</i>.  If this relationship holds then it is
 * guaranteed that every string that can be encoded in <i>D</i> can also be
 * encoded in <i>C</i> without performing any replacements.
 *
 * <p> That <i>C</i> contains <i>D</i> does not imply that each character
 * representable in <i>C</i> by a particular byte sequence is represented
 * in <i>D</i> by the same byte sequence, although sometimes this is the
 * case.
 *
 * <p> Every charset contains itself.
 *
 * <p> This method computes an approximation of the containment relation:
 * If it returns <tt>true</tt> then the given charset is known to be
 * contained by this charset; if it returns <tt>false</tt>, however, then
 * it is not necessarily the case that the given charset is not contained
 * in this charset.
 *
 * @param   cs
 *          The given charset
 *
 * @return  <tt>true</tt> if the given charset is contained in this charset
