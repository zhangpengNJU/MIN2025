/**
 * Binds the channel's socket to a local address and configures the socket to
 * listen for connections.
 *
 * <p> This method is used to establish an association between the socket and
 * a local address. Once an association is established then the socket remains
 * bound until the associated channel is closed.
 *
 * <p> The {@code backlog} parameter is the maximum number of pending
 * connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific.
 * In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length or may choose
 * to ignore the parameter altogther. If the {@code backlog} parameter has
 * the value {@code 0}, or a negative value, then an implementation specific
 * default is used.
 *
 * @param   local
 *          The local address to bind the socket, or {@code null} to bind
 *          to an automatically assigned socket address
 * @param   backlog
 *          The maximum number of pending connections
 *
 * @return  This channel
 *
 * @throws  AlreadyBoundException
 *          If the socket is already bound
 * @throws  UnsupportedAddressTypeException
 *          If the type of the given address is not supported
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager has been installed and its {@link
 *          SecurityManager#checkListen checkListen} method denies the operation
 * @throws  ClosedChannelException
 *          If the channel is closed
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If some other I/O error occurs
