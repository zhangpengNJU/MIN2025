/**
 * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.
 *
 * <p> Bytes are written starting at this channel's current position, unless
 * the channel is connected to an entity such as a file that is opened with
 * the {@link java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND} option, in
 * which case the position is first advanced to the end. The entity to which
 * the channel is connected is grown, if necessary, to accommodate the
 * written bytes, and then the position is updated with the number of bytes
 * actually written. Otherwise this method behaves exactly as specified by
 * the {@link WritableByteChannel} interface.
