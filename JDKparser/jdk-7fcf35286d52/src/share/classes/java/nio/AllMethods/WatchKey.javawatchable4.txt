/**
 * Returns the object for which this watch key was created. This method will

 * <p> As the {@code WatchService} is intended to map directly on to the
 * native file event notification facility (where available) then many of
 * details on how registered objects are watched is highly implementation
 * specific. When watching a directory for changes for example, and the
 * directory is moved or renamed in the file system, there is no guarantee
 * that the watch key will be cancelled and so the object returned by this
 * method may no longer be a valid path to the directory.
