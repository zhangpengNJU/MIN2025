/**
 * Sets this channel's position.
 *
 * <p> Setting the position to a value that is greater than the current size
 * is legal but does not change the size of the entity.  A later attempt to
 * read bytes at such a position will immediately return an end-of-file
 * indication.  A later attempt to write bytes at such a position will cause
 * the entity to grow to accommodate the new bytes; the values of any bytes
 * between the previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes are
 * unspecified.
 *
 * <p> Setting the channel's position is not recommended when connected to
 * an entity, typically a file, that is opened with the {@link
 * java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND} option. When opened for
 * append, the position is first advanced to the end before writing.
 *
 * @param  newPosition
 *         The new position, a non-negative integer counting
 *         the number of bytes from the beginning of the entity
 *
 * @return  This channel
 *
 * @throws  ClosedChannelException
 *          If this channel is closed
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the new position is negative
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If some other I/O error occurs
