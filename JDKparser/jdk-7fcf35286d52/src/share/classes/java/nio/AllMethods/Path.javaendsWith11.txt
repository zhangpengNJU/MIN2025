/**
 * Tests if this path ends with a {@code Path}, constructed by converting
 * the given path string, in exactly the manner specified by the {@link
 * #endsWith(Path) endsWith(Path)} method. On UNIX for example, the path
 * "{@code foo/bar}" ends with "{@code foo/bar}" and "{@code bar}". It does
 * not end with "{@code r}" or "{@code /bar}". Note that trailing separators
 * are not taken into account, and so invoking this method on the {@code
 * Path}"{@code foo/bar}" with the {@code String} "{@code bar/}" returns
 * {@code true}.
 *
 * @param   other
 *          the given path string
 *
 * @return  {@code true} if this path ends with the given path; otherwise
 *          {@code false}
 *
 * @throws  InvalidPathException
 *          If the path string cannot be converted to a Path.
