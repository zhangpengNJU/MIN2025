/**
 * Flips this buffer.  The limit is set to the current position and then
 * the position is set to zero.  If the mark is defined then it is
 * discarded.
 *
 * <p> After a sequence of channel-read or <i>put</i> operations, invoke
 * this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative
 * <i>get</i> operations.  For example:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * buf.put(magic);    // Prepend header
 * in.read(buf);      // Read data into rest of buffer
 * buf.flip();        // Flip buffer
 * out.write(buf);    // Write header + data to channel</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> This method is often used in conjunction with the {@link
 * java.nio.ByteBuffer#compact compact} method when transferring data from
 * one place to another.  </p>
