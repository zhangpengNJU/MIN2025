/**
 * Tests this path for equality with the given object.

 * <p> Whether or not two path are equal depends on the file system
 * implementation. In some cases the paths are compared without regard
 * to case, and others are case sensitive. This method does not access the
 * file system and the file is not required to exist. Where required, the
 * {@link Files#isSameFile isSameFile} method may be used to check if two
 * paths locate the same file.

 * <p> This method satisfies the general contract of the {@link
 * java.lang.Object#equals(Object) Object.equals} method. </p>
