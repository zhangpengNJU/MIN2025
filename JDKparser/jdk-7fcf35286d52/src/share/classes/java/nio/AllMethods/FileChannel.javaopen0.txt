/**
 * Opens or creates a file, returning a file channel to access the file.
 *
 * <p> The {@code options} parameter determines how the file is opened.
 * The {@link StandardOpenOption#READ READ} and {@link StandardOpenOption#WRITE
 * WRITE} options determine if the file should be opened for reading and/or
 * writing. If neither option (or the {@link StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND}
 * option) is contained in the array then the file is opened for reading.
 * By default reading or writing commences at the beginning of the file.
 *
 * <p> In the addition to {@code READ} and {@code WRITE}, the following
 * options may be present:
 *
 * <table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary="">
 * <tr> <th>Option</th> <th>Description</th> </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td> {@link StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND} </td>
 *   <td> If this option is present then the file is opened for writing and
 *     each invocation of the channel's {@code write} method first advances
 *     the position to the end of the file and then writes the requested
 *     data. Whether the advancement of the position and the writing of the
 *     data are done in a single atomic operation is system-dependent and
 *     therefore unspecified. This option may not be used in conjunction
 *     with the {@code READ} or {@code TRUNCATE_EXISTING} options. </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td> {@link StandardOpenOption#TRUNCATE_EXISTING TRUNCATE_EXISTING} </td>
 *   <td> If this option is present then the existing file is truncated to
 *   a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only
 *   for reading. </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td> {@link StandardOpenOption#CREATE_NEW CREATE_NEW} </td>
 *   <td> If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if
 *   the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the
 *   existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist
 *   is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is
 *   ignored when the file is opened only for reading. </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td > {@link StandardOpenOption#CREATE CREATE} </td>
 *   <td> If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it
 *   exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check
 *   for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does
 *   not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This
 *   option is ignored if the {@code CREATE_NEW} option is also present or
 *   the file is opened only for reading. </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td > {@link StandardOpenOption#DELETE_ON_CLOSE DELETE_ON_CLOSE} </td>
 *   <td> When this option is present then the implementation makes a
 *   <em>best effort</em> attempt to delete the file when closed by the
 *   the {@link #close close} method. If the {@code close} method is not
 *   invoked then a <em>best effort</em> attempt is made to delete the file
 *   when the Java virtual machine terminates. </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td>{@link StandardOpenOption#SPARSE SPARSE} </td>
 *   <td> When creating a new file this option is a <em>hint</em> that the
 *   new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating
 *   a new file. </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td> {@link StandardOpenOption#SYNC SYNC} </td>
 *   <td> Requires that every update to the file's content or metadata be
 *   written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see <a
 *   href="../file/package-summary.html#integrity"> Synchronized I/O file
 *   integrity</a>). </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *   <td> {@link StandardOpenOption#DSYNC DSYNC} </td>
 *   <td> Requires that every update to the file's content be written
 *   synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see <a

 *   integrity</a>). </td>

 *
 * <p> An implementation may also support additional options.
 *
 * <p> The {@code attrs} parameter is an optional array of file {@link
 * FileAttribute file-attributes} to set atomically when creating the file.
 *
 * <p> The new channel is created by invoking the {@link
 * FileSystemProvider#newFileChannel newFileChannel} method on the
 * provider that created the {@code Path}.

 *          If the set contains an invalid combination of options
 * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
 *          If the {@code path} is associated with a provider that does not
 *          support creating file channels, or an unsupported open option is
 *          specified, or the array contains an attribute that cannot be set
 *          atomically when creating the file
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If an I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager is installed and it denies an
 *          unspecified permission required by the implementation.
 *          In the case of the default provider, the {@link
 *          SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked to check
 *          read access if the file is opened for reading. The {@link
 *          SecurityManager#checkWrite(String)} method is invoked to check
 *          write access if the file is opened for writing
