/**
 * Tests whether a file is writable. This method checks that a file exists
 * and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges that would
 * allow it open the file for writing. Depending on the implementation, this
 * method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or
 * other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file.
 * Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file
 * system operations.
 *
 * <p> Note that result of this method is immediately outdated, there is no
 * guarantee that a subsequent attempt to open the file for writing will
 * succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken
 * when using this method in security sensitive applications.
 *
 * @param   path
 *          the path to the file to check
 *
 * @return  {@code true} if the file exists and is writable; {@code false}
 *          if the file does not exist, write access would be denied because
 *          the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access
 *          cannot be determined
 *
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
 *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkWrite(String) checkWrite}
 *          is invoked to check write access to the file.
