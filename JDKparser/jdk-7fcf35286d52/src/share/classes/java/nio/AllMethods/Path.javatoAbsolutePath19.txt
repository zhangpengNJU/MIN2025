/**
 * Returns a {@code Path} object representing the absolute path of this
 * path.
 *
 * <p> If this path is already {@link Path#isAbsolute absolute} then this
 * method simply returns this path. Otherwise, this method resolves the path
 * in an implementation dependent manner, typically by resolving the path
 * against a file system default directory. Depending on the implementation,
 * this method may throw an I/O error if the file system is not accessible.
 *
 * @return  a {@code Path} object representing the absolute path
 *
 * @throws  java.io.IOError
 *          if an I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          In the case of the default provider, a security manager
 *          is installed, and this path is not absolute, then the security
 *          manager's {@link SecurityManager#checkPropertyAccess(String)
 *          checkPropertyAccess} method is invoked to check access to the
 *          system property {@code user.dir}
