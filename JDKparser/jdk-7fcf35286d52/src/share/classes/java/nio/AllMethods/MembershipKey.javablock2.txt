/**
 * Block multicast datagrams from the given source address.
 *
 * <p> If this membership key is not source-specific, and the underlying
 * operating system supports source filtering, then this method blocks
 * multicast datagrams from the given source address. If the given source
 * address is already blocked then this method has no effect.
 * After a source address is blocked it may still be possible to receive
 * datagrams from that source. This can arise when datagrams are waiting to
 * be received in the socket's receive buffer.
 *
 * @param   source
 *          The source address to block
 *
 * @return  This membership key
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the {@code source} parameter is not a unicast address or
 *          is not the same address type as the multicast group
 * @throws  IllegalStateException
 *          If this membership key is source-specific or is no longer valid
 * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
 *          If the underlying operating system does not support source
 *          filtering
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If an I/O error occurs
