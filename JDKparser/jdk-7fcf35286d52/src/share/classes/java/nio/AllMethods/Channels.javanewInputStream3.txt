// -- Byte streams from channels --
/**
 * Constructs a stream that reads bytes from the given channel.
 *
 * <p> The <tt>read</tt> methods of the resulting stream will throw an
 * {@link IllegalBlockingModeException} if invoked while the underlying
 * channel is in non-blocking mode.  The stream will not be buffered, and
 * it will not support the {@link InputStream#mark mark} or {@link
 * InputStream#reset reset} methods.  The stream will be safe for access by
 * multiple concurrent threads.  Closing the stream will in turn cause the
 * channel to be closed.  </p>

 * @param  ch
 *         The channel from which bytes will be read
