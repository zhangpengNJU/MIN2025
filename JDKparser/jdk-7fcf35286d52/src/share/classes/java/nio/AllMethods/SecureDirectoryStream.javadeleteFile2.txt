/**
 * Deletes a file.
 *
 * <p> Unlike the {@link Files#delete delete()} method, this method does
 * not first examine the file to determine if the file is a directory.
 * Whether a directory is deleted by this method is system dependent and
 * therefore not specified. If the file is a symbolic link, then the link
 * itself, not the final target of the link, is deleted. When the
 * parameter is a relative path then the file to delete is relative to
 * this open directory.
 *
 * @param   path
 *          the path of the file to delete
 *
 * @throws  ClosedDirectoryStreamException
 *          if the directory stream is closed
 * @throws  NoSuchFileException
 *          if the file does not exist <i>(optional specific exception)</i>
 * @throws  IOException
 *          if an I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
 *          installed, the {@link SecurityManager#checkDelete(String) checkDelete}
 *          method is invoked to check delete access to the file
