/**
 * Reads some bytes from an input
 * stream and stores them into the buffer
 * array {@code b}. The number of bytes
 * read is equal
 * to the length of {@code b}.
 * <p>
 * This method blocks until one of the
 * following conditions occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code b.length}
 * bytes of input data are available, in which
 * case a normal return is made.
 *
 * <li>End of
 * file is detected, in which case an {@code EOFException}
 * is thrown.
 *
 * <li>An I/O error occurs, in
 * which case an {@code IOException} other
 * than {@code EOFException} is thrown.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If {@code b} is {@code null},
 * a {@code NullPointerException} is thrown.
 * If {@code b.length} is zero, then
 * no bytes are read. Otherwise, the first
 * byte read is stored into element {@code b[0]},
 * the next one into {@code b[1]}, and
 * so on.
 * If an exception is thrown from
 * this method, then it may be that some but
 * not all bytes of {@code b} have been
 * updated with data from the input stream.
 *
 * @param     b   the buffer into which the data is read.
 * @exception  EOFException  if this stream reaches the end before reading
 *               all the bytes.
 * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
