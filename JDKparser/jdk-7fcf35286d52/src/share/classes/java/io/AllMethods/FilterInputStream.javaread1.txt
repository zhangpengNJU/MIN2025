/**
 * Reads up to <code>byte.length</code> bytes of data from this

 * This method simply performs the call

 * the  result. It is important that it does
 * <i>not</i> do <code>in.read(b)</code> instead;
 * certain subclasses of  <code>FilterInputStream</code>
 * depend on the implementation strategy actually
 * used.
 *
 * @param      b   the buffer into which the data is read.
 * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
 *             <code>-1</code> if there is no more data because the end of
 *             the stream has been reached.
 * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
 * @see        java.io.FilterInputStream#read(byte[], int, int)
