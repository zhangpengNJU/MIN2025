/**
 * Specifies that matching pairs of this character delimit string
 * constants in this tokenizer.
 * <p>
 * When the {@code nextToken} method encounters a string
 * constant, the {@code ttype} field is set to the string
 * delimiter and the {@code sval} field is set to the body of
 * the string.
 * <p>
 * If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
 * recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
 * the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
 * occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
 * terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as
 * {@code "\u005Cn"} and {@code "\u005Ct"} are recognized and
 * converted to single characters as the string is parsed.
 *
 * <p>Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.
 *
 * @param   ch   the character.
 * @see     java.io.StreamTokenizer#nextToken()
