/**
 * Subclasses may implement this method to store custom data in the stream
 * along with descriptors for dynamic proxy classes.
 *
 * <p>This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class
 * descriptor in the stream.  The default implementation of this method in
 * <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> does nothing.
 *
 * <p>The corresponding method in <code>ObjectInputStream</code> is
 * <code>resolveProxyClass</code>.  For a given subclass of
 * <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> that overrides this method, the
 * <code>resolveProxyClass</code> method in the corresponding subclass of
 * <code>ObjectInputStream</code> must read any data or objects written by
 * <code>annotateProxyClass</code>.
 *
 * @param   cl the proxy class to annotate custom data for
 * @throws  IOException any exception thrown by the underlying
 *          <code>OutputStream</code>
 * @see ObjectInputStream#resolveProxyClass(String[])
