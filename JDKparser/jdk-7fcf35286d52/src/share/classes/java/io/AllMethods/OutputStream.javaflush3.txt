/**
 * Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes
 * to be written out. The general contract of <code>flush</code> is
 * that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously
 * written have been buffered by the implementation of the output
 * stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their
 * intended destination.
 * <p>
 * If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided by
 * the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
 * stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
 * passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
 * they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.
 * <p>
 * The <code>flush</code> method of <code>OutputStream</code> does nothing.
 *
 * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
