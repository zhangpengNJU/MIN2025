/**
 * Reads up to {@code b.length} bytes of data from this file

 * {@code InputStream}, this method behaves in exactly the
 * same way as the {@link InputStream#read(byte[])} method of
 * {@code InputStream}.
 *
 * @param      b   the buffer into which the data is read.
 * @return     the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
 *             {@code -1} if there is no more data because the end of
 *             this file has been reached.
 * @exception  IOException If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
 * other than end of file, or if the random access file has been closed, or if
 * some other I/O error occurs.
 * @exception  NullPointerException If {@code b} is {@code null}.
