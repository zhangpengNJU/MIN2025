/**
 * Reads four input bytes and returns

 * value to a {@code float} in
 * exactly the manner of the method {@code Float.intBitsToFloat}.
 * This method is suitable for reading
 * bytes written by the {@code writeFloat}
 * method of interface {@code DataOutput}.
 *
 * @return     the {@code float} value read.
 * @exception  EOFException  if this stream reaches the end before reading
 *               all the bytes.
 * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
