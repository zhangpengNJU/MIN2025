/**
 * Writes two bytes of length information
 * to the output stream, followed
 * by the
 * <a href="DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
 * representation
 * of  every character in the string <code>s</code>.
 * If <code>s</code> is <code>null</code>,
 * a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.
 * Each character in the string <code>s</code>
 * is converted to a group of one, two, or
 * three bytes, depending on the value of the
 * character.<p>
 * If a character <code>c</code>
 * is in the range <code>&#92;u0001</code> through
 * <code>&#92;u007f</code>, it is represented
 * by one byte:
 * <pre>(byte)c </pre>  <p>
 * If a character <code>c</code> is <code>&#92;u0000</code>
 * or is in the range <code>&#92;u0080</code>
 * through <code>&#92;u07ff</code>, then it is
 * represented by two bytes, to be written
 * in the order shown: <pre>{@code
 * (byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f & (c >> 6)))
 * (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
 * }</pre> <p> If a character
 * <code>c</code> is in the range <code>&#92;u0800</code>
 * through <code>uffff</code>, then it is
 * represented by three bytes, to be written
 * in the order shown: <pre>{@code
 * (byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f & (c >> 12)))
 * (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & (c >>  6)))
 * (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f & c))
 * }</pre>  <p> First,
 * the total number of bytes needed to represent
 * all the characters of <code>s</code> is
 * calculated. If this number is larger than
 * <code>65535</code>, then a <code>UTFDataFormatException</code>
 * is thrown. Otherwise, this length is written
 * to the output stream in exactly the manner
 * of the <code>writeShort</code> method;
 * after this, the one-, two-, or three-byte
 * representation of each character in the
 * string <code>s</code> is written.<p>  The
 * bytes written by this method may be read
 * by the <code>readUTF</code> method of interface
 * <code>DataInput</code> , which will then
 * return a <code>String</code> equal to <code>s</code>.
 *
 * @param      s   the string value to be written.
 * @throws     IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
