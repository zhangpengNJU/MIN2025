 * Writes a string to the output stream.

 * is thrown.<p>  If <code>s.length</code>
 * is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise,
 * the character <code>s[0]</code> is written
 * first, then <code>s[1]</code>, and so on;
 * the last character written is <code>s[s.length-1]</code>.
 * For each character, one byte is written,
 * the low-order byte, in exactly the manner
