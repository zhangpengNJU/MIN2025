/**
 * Flushes the stream.  If the stream has saved any characters from the
 * various write() methods in a buffer, write them immediately to their
 * intended destination.  Then, if that destination is another character or
 * byte stream, flush it.  Thus one flush() invocation will flush all the
 * buffers in a chain of Writers and OutputStreams.
 *
 * <p> If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided
 * by the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
 * stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
 * passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
 * they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.

 * @throws  IOException
