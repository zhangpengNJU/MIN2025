/**
 * Writes a string to the underlying output stream using
 * <a href="DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
 * encoding in a machine-independent manner.
 * <p>
 * First, two bytes are written to the output stream as if by the
 * <code>writeShort</code> method giving the number of bytes to
 * follow. This value is the number of bytes actually written out,
 * not the length of the string. Following the length, each character
 * of the string is output, in sequence, using the modified UTF-8 encoding
 * for the character. If no exception is thrown, the counter
 * <code>written</code> is incremented by the total number of
 * bytes written to the output stream. This will be at least two
 * plus the length of <code>str</code>, and at most two plus
 * thrice the length of <code>str</code>.
 *
 * @param      str   a string to be written.
 * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
