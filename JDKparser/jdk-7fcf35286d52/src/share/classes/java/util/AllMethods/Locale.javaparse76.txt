/**
 * Parses the given {@code ranges} to generate a Language Priority List.
 *
 * <p>This method performs a syntactic check for each language range in
 * the given {@code ranges} but doesn't do validation using the IANA
 * Language Subtag Registry.
 *
 * <p>The {@code ranges} to be given can take one of the following
 * forms:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   "Accept-Language: ja,en;q=0.4"  (weighted list with Accept-Language prefix)
 *   "ja,en;q=0.4"                   (weighted list)
 *   "ja,en"                         (prioritized list)
 * </pre>
 *
 * In a weighted list, each language range is given a weight value.
 * The weight value is identical to the "quality value" in
 * <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a>, and it
 * expresses how much the user prefers  the language. A weight value is
 * specified after a corresponding language range followed by
 * {@code ";q="}, and the default weight value is {@code MAX_WEIGHT}
 * when it is omitted.
 *
 * <p>Unlike a weighted list, language ranges in a prioritized list
 * are sorted in the descending order based on its priority. The first
 * language range has the highest priority and meets the user's
 * preference most.
 *
 * <p>In either case, language ranges are sorted in descending order in
 * the Language Priority List based on priority or weight. If a
 * language range appears in the given {@code ranges} more than once,
 * only the first one is included on the Language Priority List.
 *
 * <p>The returned list consists of language ranges from the given
 * {@code ranges} and their equivalents found in the IANA Language
 * Subtag Registry. For example, if the given {@code ranges} is
 * {@code "Accept-Language: iw,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3"}, the elements in
 * the list to be returned are:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  <b>Range</b>                                   <b>Weight</b>
 *    "iw" (older tag for Hebrew)             1.0
 *    "he" (new preferred code for Hebrew)    1.0
 *    "en-us" (English, United States)        0.7
 *    "en" (English)                          0.3
 * </pre>
 *
 * Two language ranges, {@code "iw"} and {@code "he"}, have the same
 * highest priority in the list. By adding {@code "he"} to the user's
 * Language Priority List, locale-matching method can find Hebrew as a
 * matching locale (or language tag) even if the application or system
 * offers only {@code "he"} as a supported locale (or language tag).
 *
 * @param ranges a list of comma-separated language ranges or a list of
 *     language ranges in the form of the "Accept-Language" header
 *     defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC
 *     2616</a>
 * @return a Language Priority List consisting of language ranges
 *     included in the given {@code ranges} and their equivalent
 *     language ranges if available. The list is modifiable.
 * @throws NullPointerException if {@code ranges} is null
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if a language range or a weight
 *     found in the given {@code ranges} is ill-formed
