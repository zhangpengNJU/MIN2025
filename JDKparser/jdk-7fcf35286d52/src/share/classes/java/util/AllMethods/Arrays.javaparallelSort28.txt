/**
 * Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order.
 *
 * <p>The {@code <} relation does not provide a total order on all double
 * values: {@code -0.0d == 0.0d} is {@code true} and a {@code Double.NaN}
 * value compares neither less than, greater than, nor equal to any value,
 * even itself. This method uses the total order imposed by the method
 * {@link Double#compareTo}: {@code -0.0d} is treated as less than value
 * {@code 0.0d} and {@code Double.NaN} is considered greater than any
 * other value and all {@code Double.NaN} values are considered equal.
 *
 * @implNote The sorting algorithm is a parallel sort-merge that breaks the
 * array into sub-arrays that are themselves sorted and then merged. When
 * the sub-array length reaches a minimum granularity, the sub-array is
 * sorted using the appropriate {@link Arrays#sort(double[]) Arrays.sort}
 * method. If the length of the specified array is less than the minimum
 * granularity, then it is sorted using the appropriate {@link
 * Arrays#sort(double[]) Arrays.sort} method. The algorithm requires a
 * working space no greater than the size of the original array. The
 * {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool() ForkJoin common pool} is used to
 * execute any parallel tasks.
 *
 * @param a the array to be sorted
