// Iterators
/**
 * Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence.
 *
 * <p>This implementation returns a straightforward implementation of the
 * iterator interface, relying on the backing list's {@code size()},
 * {@code get(int)}, and {@code remove(int)} methods.
 *
 * <p>Note that the iterator returned by this method will throw an
 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} in response to its
 * {@code remove} method unless the list's {@code remove(int)} method is
 * overridden.
 *
 * <p>This implementation can be made to throw runtime exceptions in the
 * face of concurrent modification, as described in the specification
 * for the (protected) {@link #modCount} field.
 *
 * @return an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence
