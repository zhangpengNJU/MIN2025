/**
 * Generates a hash code for a sequence of input values. The hash
 * code is generated as if all the input values were placed into an
 * array, and that array were hashed by calling {@link
 * Arrays#hashCode(Object[])}.
 *
 * <p>This method is useful for implementing {@link
 * Object#hashCode()} on objects containing multiple fields. For
 * example, if an object that has three fields, {@code x}, {@code
 * y}, and {@code z}, one could write:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * &#064;Override public int hashCode() {
 *     return Objects.hash(x, y, z);
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <b>Warning: When a single object reference is supplied, the returned
 * value does not equal the hash code of that object reference.</b> This
 * value can be computed by calling {@link #hashCode(Object)}.
 *
 * @param values the values to be hashed
 * @return a hash value of the sequence of input values
 * @see Arrays#hashCode(Object[])
 * @see List#hashCode
