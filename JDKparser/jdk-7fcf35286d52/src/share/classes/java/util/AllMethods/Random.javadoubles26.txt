/**
 * Returns an effectively unlimited stream of pseudorandom {@code
 * double} values, each conforming to the given origin (inclusive) and bound
 * (exclusive).
 *
 * <p>A pseudorandom {@code double} value is generated as if it's the result
 * of calling the following method with the origin and bound:
 * <pre> {@code
 * double nextDouble(double origin, double bound) {
 *   double r = nextDouble();
 *   r = r * (bound - origin) + origin;
 *   if (r >= bound) // correct for rounding
 *     r = Math.nextDown(bound);
 *   return r;
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * @implNote This method is implemented to be equivalent to {@code
 * doubles(Long.MAX_VALUE, randomNumberOrigin, randomNumberBound)}.
 *
 * @param randomNumberOrigin the origin (inclusive) of each random value
 * @param randomNumberBound the bound (exclusive) of each random value
 * @return a stream of pseudorandom {@code double} values,
 *         each with the given origin (inclusive) and bound (exclusive)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if {@code randomNumberOrigin}
 *         is greater than or equal to {@code randomNumberBound}
 * @since 1.8
