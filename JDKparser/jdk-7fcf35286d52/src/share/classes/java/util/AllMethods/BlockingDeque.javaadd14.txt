// *** BlockingQueue methods ***
/**
 * Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque

 * {@code IllegalStateException} if no space is currently available.
 * When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to
 * use {@link #offer(Object) offer}.
 *
 * <p>This method is equivalent to {@link #addLast(Object) addLast}.
 *
 * @param e the element to add
 * @throws IllegalStateException {@inheritDoc}
 * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified element
 *         prevents it from being added to this deque
 * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified
 *         element prevents it from being added to this deque
