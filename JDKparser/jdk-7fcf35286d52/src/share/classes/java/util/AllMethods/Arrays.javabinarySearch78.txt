/**
 * Searches a range of
 * the specified array for the specified object using the binary
 * search algorithm.
 * The range must be sorted into ascending order
 * according to the specified comparator (as by the
 * {@link #sort(Object[], int, int, Comparator)
 * sort(T[], int, int, Comparator)}
 * method) prior to making this call.
 * If it is not sorted, the results are undefined.
 * If the range contains multiple elements equal to the specified object,
 * there is no guarantee which one will be found.
 *
 * @param <T> the class of the objects in the array
 * @param a the array to be searched
 * @param fromIndex the index of the first element (inclusive) to be
 *          searched
 * @param toIndex the index of the last element (exclusive) to be searched
 * @param key the value to be searched for
 * @param c the comparator by which the array is ordered.  A
 *        <tt>null</tt> value indicates that the elements'
 *        {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} should be used.
 * @return index of the search key, if it is contained in the array
 *         within the specified range;
 *         otherwise, <tt>(-(<i>insertion point</i>) - 1)</tt>.  The
 *         <i>insertion point</i> is defined as the point at which the
 *         key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first
 *         element in the range greater than the key,
 *         or <tt>toIndex</tt> if all
 *         elements in the range are less than the specified key.  Note
 *         that this guarantees that the return value will be &gt;= 0 if
 *         and only if the key is found.
 * @throws ClassCastException if the range contains elements that are not
 *         <i>mutually comparable</i> using the specified comparator,
 *         or the search key is not comparable to the
 *         elements in the range using this comparator.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
 *         if {@code fromIndex > toIndex}
 * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 *         if {@code fromIndex < 0 or toIndex > a.length}
