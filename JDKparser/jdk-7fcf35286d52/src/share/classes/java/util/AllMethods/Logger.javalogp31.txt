/**
 * Log a message, specifying source class and method,
 * with associated Throwable information.
 * <p>
 * If the logger is currently enabled for the given message
 * level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord
 * which is forwarded to all registered output handlers.
 * <p>
 * Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown
 * property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property.  Thus it is
 * processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated
 * as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property.
 * <p>
 * @param   level   One of the message level identifiers, e.g., SEVERE
 * @param   sourceClass    name of class that issued the logging request
 * @param   sourceMethod   name of method that issued the logging request
 * @param   msg     The string message (or a key in the message catalog)
 * @param   thrown  Throwable associated with log message.
