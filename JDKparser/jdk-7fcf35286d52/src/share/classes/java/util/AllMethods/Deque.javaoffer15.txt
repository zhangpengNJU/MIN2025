/**
 * Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque
 * (in other words, at the tail of this deque) if it is possible to do so
 * immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning
 * {@code true} upon success and {@code false} if no space is currently
 * available.  When using a capacity-restricted deque, this method is
 * generally preferable to the {@link #add} method, which can fail to
 * insert an element only by throwing an exception.
 *
 * <p>This method is equivalent to {@link #offerLast}.
 *
 * @param e the element to add
 * @return {@code true} if the element was added to this deque, else
 *         {@code false}
 * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified element
 *         prevents it from being added to this deque
 * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null and this
 *         deque does not permit null elements
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified
 *         element prevents it from being added to this deque
