/**
 * Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code long}
 * value from this random number generator's sequence. The general
 * contract of {@code nextLong} is that one {@code long} value is
 * pseudorandomly generated and returned.
 *
 * <p>The method {@code nextLong} is implemented by class {@code Random}
 * as if by:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * public long nextLong() {
 *   return ((long)next(32) << 32) + next(32);
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Because class {@code Random} uses a seed with only 48 bits,
 * this algorithm will not return all possible {@code long} values.
 *
 * @return the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed {@code long}
 *         value from this random number generator's sequence
