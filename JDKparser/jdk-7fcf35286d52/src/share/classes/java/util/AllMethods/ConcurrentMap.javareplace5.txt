/**
 * Replaces the entry for a key only if currently mapped to some value.
 * This is equivalent to
 *  <pre> {@code
 * if (map.containsKey(key)) {
 *   return map.put(key, value);
 * } else
 *   return null;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * except that the action is performed atomically.
 *
 * @implNote This implementation intentionally re-abstracts the
 * inappropriate default provided in {@code Map}.
 *
 * @param key key with which the specified value is associated
 * @param value value to be associated with the specified key
 * @return the previous value associated with the specified key, or
 *         {@code null} if there was no mapping for the key.
 *         (A {@code null} return can also indicate that the map
 *         previously associated {@code null} with the key,
 *         if the implementation supports null values.)
 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the {@code put} operation
 *         is not supported by this map
 * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified key or value
 *         prevents it from being stored in this map
 * @throws NullPointerException if the specified key or value is null,
 *         and this map does not permit null keys or values
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified key
 *         or value prevents it from being stored in this map
