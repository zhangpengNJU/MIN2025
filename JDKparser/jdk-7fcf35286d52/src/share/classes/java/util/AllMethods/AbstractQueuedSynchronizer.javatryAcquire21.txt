// Main exported methods
/**
 * Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode. This method should query
 * if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the
 * exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.
 *
 * <p>This method is always invoked by the thread performing
 * acquire.  If this method reports failure, the acquire method
 * may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is
 * signalled by a release from some other thread. This can be used
 * to implement method {@link Lock#tryLock()}.
 *
 * <p>The default
 * implementation throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * @param arg the acquire argument. This value is always the one
 *        passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry
 *        to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise uninterpreted
 *        and can represent anything you like.
 * @return {@code true} if successful. Upon success, this object has
 *         been acquired.
 * @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if acquiring would place this
 *         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
 *         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
 *         correctly.
 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if exclusive mode is not supported
