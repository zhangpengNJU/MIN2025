/**
 * Searches a range of
 * the specified array for the specified object using the binary
 * search algorithm.
 * The range must be sorted into ascending order
 * according to the
 * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering}
 * of its elements (as by the
 * {@link #sort(Object[], int, int)} method) prior to making this
 * call.  If it is not sorted, the results are undefined.
 * (If the range contains elements that are not mutually comparable (for
 * example, strings and integers), it <i>cannot</i> be sorted according
 * to the natural ordering of its elements, hence results are undefined.)
 * If the range contains multiple
 * elements equal to the specified object, there is no guarantee which
 * one will be found.
 *
 * @param a the array to be searched
 * @param fromIndex the index of the first element (inclusive) to be
 *          searched
 * @param toIndex the index of the last element (exclusive) to be searched
 * @param key the value to be searched for
 * @return index of the search key, if it is contained in the array
 *         within the specified range;
 *         otherwise, <tt>(-(<i>insertion point</i>) - 1)</tt>.  The
 *         <i>insertion point</i> is defined as the point at which the
 *         key would be inserted into the array: the index of the first
 *         element in the range greater than the key,
 *         or <tt>toIndex</tt> if all
 *         elements in the range are less than the specified key.  Note
 *         that this guarantees that the return value will be &gt;= 0 if
 *         and only if the key is found.
 * @throws ClassCastException if the search key is not comparable to the
 *         elements of the array within the specified range.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException
 *         if {@code fromIndex > toIndex}
 * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
 *         if {@code fromIndex < 0 or toIndex > a.length}
 * @since 1.6
