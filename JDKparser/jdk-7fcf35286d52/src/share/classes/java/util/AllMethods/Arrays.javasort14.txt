/**
 * Sorts the specified array into ascending numerical order.
 *
 * <p>The {@code <} relation does not provide a total order on all double
 * values: {@code -0.0d == 0.0d} is {@code true} and a {@code Double.NaN}
 * value compares neither less than, greater than, nor equal to any value,
 * even itself. This method uses the total order imposed by the method
 * {@link Double#compareTo}: {@code -0.0d} is treated as less than value
 * {@code 0.0d} and {@code Double.NaN} is considered greater than any
 * other value and all {@code Double.NaN} values are considered equal.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: The sorting algorithm is a Dual-Pivot Quicksort
 * by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch. This algorithm
 * offers O(n log(n)) performance on many data sets that cause other
 * quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance, and is typically
 * faster than traditional (one-pivot) Quicksort implementations.
 *
 * @param a the array to be sorted
