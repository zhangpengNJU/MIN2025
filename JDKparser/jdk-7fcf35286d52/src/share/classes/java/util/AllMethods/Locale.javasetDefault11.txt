/**
 * Sets the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
 * This does not affect the host locale.
 * <p>
 * If there is a security manager, its <code>checkPermission</code>
 * method is called with a <code>PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")</code>
 * permission before the default locale is changed.
 * <p>
 * The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
 * based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
 * methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
 * <p>
 * Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
 * of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
 * is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
 * within the same Java Virtual Machine.
 * <p>
 * By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
 * locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.
 *
 * @throws SecurityException
 *        if a security manager exists and its
 *        <code>checkPermission</code> method doesn't allow the operation.
 * @throws NullPointerException if <code>newLocale</code> is null
 * @param newLocale the new default locale
 * @see SecurityManager#checkPermission
 * @see java.util.PropertyPermission
