 * Disables the current thread for thread scheduling purposes, for up to

 *
 * <p>If the permit is available then it is consumed and the call
 * returns immediately; otherwise the current thread becomes disabled
 * for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four
 * things happens:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Some other thread invokes {@link #unpark unpark} with the
 * current thread as the target; or
 *
 * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
 * the current thread; or
 *
 * <li>The specified waiting time elapses; or
 *
 * <li>The call spuriously (that is, for no reason) returns.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This method does <em>not</em> report which of these caused the
 * method to return. Callers should re-check the conditions which caused
 * the thread to park in the first place. Callers may also determine,
 * for example, the interrupt status of the thread, or the elapsed time
 * upon return.
 *
 * @param nanos the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait
