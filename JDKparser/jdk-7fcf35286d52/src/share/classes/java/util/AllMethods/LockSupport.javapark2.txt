 * Disables the current thread for thread scheduling purposes unless the

 * <p>If the permit is available then it is consumed and the call returns
 * immediately; otherwise
 * the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
 * purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Some other thread invokes {@link #unpark unpark} with the
 * current thread as the target; or
 *
 * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
 * the current thread; or
 *
 * <li>The call spuriously (that is, for no reason) returns.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This method does <em>not</em> report which of these caused the
 * method to return. Callers should re-check the conditions which caused
 * the thread to park in the first place. Callers may also determine,
 * for example, the interrupt status of the thread upon return.
