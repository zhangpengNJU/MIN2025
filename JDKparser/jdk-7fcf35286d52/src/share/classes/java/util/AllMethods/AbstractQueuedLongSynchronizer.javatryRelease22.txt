 *
 * @param arg the release argument. This value is always the one
 *        passed to a release method, or the current state value upon
 *        entry to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise
 *        uninterpreted and can represent anything you like.
 * @return {@code true} if this object is now in a fully released
 *         state, so that any waiting threads may attempt to acquire;
 *         and {@code false} otherwise.
 * @throws IllegalMonitorStateException if releasing would place this
 *         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
 *         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
 *         correctly.
 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if exclusive mode is not supported
