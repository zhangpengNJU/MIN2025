/**
 * Emits on the specified output stream an XML document representing all
 * of the preferences contained in this node (but not its descendants).
 * This XML document is, in effect, an offline backup of the node.
 *
 * <p>The XML document will have the following DOCTYPE declaration:
 * <pre>{@code
 * <!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
 * }</pre>
 * The UTF-8 character encoding will be used.
 *
 * <p>This method is an exception to the general rule that the results of
 * concurrently executing multiple methods in this class yields
 * results equivalent to some serial execution.  If the preferences
 * at this node are modified concurrently with an invocation of this
 * method, the exported preferences comprise a "fuzzy snapshot" of the
 * preferences contained in the node; some of the concurrent modifications
 * may be reflected in the exported data while others may not.
 *
 * @param os the output stream on which to emit the XML document.
 * @throws IOException if writing to the specified output stream
 *         results in an <tt>IOException</tt>.
 * @throws BackingStoreException if preference data cannot be read from
 *         backing store.
 * @see    #importPreferences(InputStream)
 * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
 *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.
