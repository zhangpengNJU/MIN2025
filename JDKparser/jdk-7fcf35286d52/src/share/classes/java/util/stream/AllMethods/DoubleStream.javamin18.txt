/**
 * Returns an {@code OptionalDouble} describing the minimum element of this

 * element will be {@code Double.NaN} if any stream element was NaN. Unlike

 * to be strictly smaller than positive zero. This is a special case of a
 * <a href="package-summary.html#Reduction">reduction</a> and is
 * equivalent to:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     return reduce(Double::min);
 * }</pre>

 * @return an {@code OptionalDouble} containing the minimum element of this
