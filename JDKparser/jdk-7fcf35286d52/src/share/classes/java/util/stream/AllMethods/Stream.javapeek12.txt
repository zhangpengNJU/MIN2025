/**
 * Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, additionally
 * performing the provided action on each element as elements are consumed
 * from the resulting stream.
 *
 * <p>This is an <a href="package-summary.html#StreamOps">intermediate
 * operation</a>.
 *
 * <p>For parallel stream pipelines, the action may be called at
 * whatever time and in whatever thread the element is made available by the
 * upstream operation.  If the action modifies shared state,
 * it is responsible for providing the required synchronization.
 *
 * @apiNote This method exists mainly to support debugging, where you want
 * to see the elements as they flow past a certain point in a pipeline:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Stream.of("one", "two", "three", "four")
 *         .filter(e -> e.length() > 3)
 *         .peek(e -> System.out.println("Filtered value: " + e))
 *         .map(String::toUpperCase)
 *         .peek(e -> System.out.println("Mapped value: " + e))
 *         .collect(Collectors.toList());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param action a <a href="package-summary.html#NonInterference">
 *                 non-interfering</a> action to perform on the elements as
 *                 they are consumed from the stream
 * @return the new stream
