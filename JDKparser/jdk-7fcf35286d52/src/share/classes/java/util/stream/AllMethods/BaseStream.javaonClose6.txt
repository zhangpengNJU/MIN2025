/**
 * Returns an equivalent stream with an additional close handler.  Close
 * handlers are run when the {@link #close()} method
 * is called on the stream, and are executed in the order they were
 * added.  All close handlers are run, even if earlier close handlers throw
 * exceptions.  If any close handler throws an exception, the first
 * exception thrown will be relayed to the caller of {@code close()}, with
 * any remaining exceptions added to that exception as suppressed exceptions
 * (unless one of the remaining exceptions is the same exception as the
 * first exception, since an exception cannot suppress itself.)  May
 * return itself.
 *
 * <p>This is an <a href="package-summary.html#StreamOps">intermediate
 * operation</a>.
 *
 * @param closeHandler A task to execute when the stream is closed
 * @return a stream with a handler that is run if the stream is closed
