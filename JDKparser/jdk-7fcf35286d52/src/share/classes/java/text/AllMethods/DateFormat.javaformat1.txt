/**
 * Formats a Date into a date/time string.
 * @param date a Date to be formatted into a date/time string.
 * @param toAppendTo the string buffer for the returning date/time string.
 * @param fieldPosition keeps track of the position of the field
 * within the returned string.
 * On input: an alignment field,
 * if desired. On output: the offsets of the alignment field. For
 * example, given a time text "1996.07.10 AD at 15:08:56 PDT",
 * if the given fieldPosition is DateFormat.YEAR_FIELD, the
 * begin index and end index of fieldPosition will be set to
 * 0 and 4, respectively.
 * Notice that if the same time field appears
 * more than once in a pattern, the fieldPosition will be set for the first
 * occurrence of that time field. For instance, formatting a Date to
 * the time string "1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)" using the pattern
 * "h a z (zzzz)" and the alignment field DateFormat.TIMEZONE_FIELD,
 * the begin index and end index of fieldPosition will be set to
 * 5 and 8, respectively, for the first occurrence of the timezone
 * pattern character 'z'.
 * @return the string buffer passed in as toAppendTo, with formatted text appended.
