/**
 * Compares the source string to the target string according to the
 * collation rules for this Collator.  Returns an integer less than,
 * equal to or greater than zero depending on whether the source String is
 * less than, equal to or greater than the target string.  See the Collator
 * class description for an example of use.
 * <p>
 * For a one time comparison, this method has the best performance. If a
 * given String will be involved in multiple comparisons, CollationKey.compareTo
 * has the best performance. See the Collator class description for an example
 * using CollationKeys.
 * @param source the source string.
 * @param target the target string.
 * @return Returns an integer value. Value is less than zero if source is less than
 * target, value is zero if source and target are equal, value is greater than zero
 * if source is greater than target.
 * @see java.text.CollationKey
 * @see java.text.Collator#getCollationKey
