/**
 * Reorder the objects in the array into visual order based on their levels.
 * This is a utility function to use when you have a collection of objects
 * representing runs of text in logical order, each run containing text
 * at a single level.  The elements at <code>index</code> from
 * <code>objectStart</code> up to <code>objectStart + count</code>
 * in the objects array will be reordered into visual order assuming
 * each run of text has the level indicated by the corresponding element
 * in the levels array (at <code>index - objectStart + levelStart</code>).
 *
 * @param levels an array representing the bidi level of each object
 * @param levelStart the start position in the levels array
 * @param objects the array of objects to be reordered into visual order
 * @param objectStart the start position in the objects array
 * @param count the number of objects to reorder
