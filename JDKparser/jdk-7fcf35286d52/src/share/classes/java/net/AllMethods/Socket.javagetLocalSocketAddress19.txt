/**
 * Returns the address of the endpoint this socket is bound to.
 * <p>
 * If a socket bound to an endpoint represented by an
 * {@code InetSocketAddress } is {@link #close closed},
 * then this method will continue to return an {@code InetSocketAddress}
 * after the socket is closed. In that case the returned
 * {@code InetSocketAddress}'s address is the
 * {@link InetAddress#isAnyLocalAddress wildcard} address
 * and its port is the local port that it was bound to.
 * <p>
 * If there is a security manager set, its {@code checkConnect} method is
 * called with the local address and {@code -1} as its arguments to see
 * if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
 * a {@code SocketAddress} representing the
 * {@link InetAddress#getLoopbackAddress loopback} address and the local
 * port to which this socket is bound is returned.
 *
 * @return a {@code SocketAddress} representing the local endpoint of
 *         this socket, or a {@code SocketAddress} representing the
 *         loopback address if denied by the security manager, or
 *         {@code null} if the socket is not bound yet.
