 * This method is used to enable streaming of a HTTP request body

 * support this mode.
 * <p>
 * When output streaming is enabled, authentication
 * and redirection cannot be handled automatically.
 * A HttpRetryException will be thrown when reading
 * the response if authentication or redirection are required.
 * This exception can be queried for the details of the error.
 * <p>
 * This method must be called before the URLConnection is connected.
 *
 * @param   chunklen The number of bytes to write in each chunk.

 * @throws  IllegalStateException if URLConnection is already connected
 *          or if a different streaming mode is already enabled.
