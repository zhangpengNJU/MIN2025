/**
 * Compares this URL for equality with another object.<p>
 *
 * If the given object is not a URL then this method immediately returns
 * {@code false}.<p>
 *
 * Two URL objects are equal if they have the same protocol, reference
 * equivalent hosts, have the same port number on the host, and the same
 * file and fragment of the file.<p>
 *
 * Two hosts are considered equivalent if both host names can be resolved
 * into the same IP addresses; else if either host name can't be
 * resolved, the host names must be equal without regard to case; or both
 * host names equal to null.<p>
 *
 * Since hosts comparison requires name resolution, this operation is a
 * blocking operation. <p>
 *
 * Note: The defined behavior for {@code equals} is known to
 * be inconsistent with virtual hosting in HTTP.
 *
 * @param   obj   the URL to compare against.
 * @return  {@code true} if the objects are the same;
 *          {@code false} otherwise.
