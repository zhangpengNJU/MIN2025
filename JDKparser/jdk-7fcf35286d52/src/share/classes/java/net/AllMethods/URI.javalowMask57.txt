// -- Character classes for parsing --
// RFC2396 precisely specifies which characters in the US-ASCII charset are
// permissible in the various components of a URI reference.  We here
// define a set of mask pairs to aid in enforcing these restrictions.  Each
// mask pair consists of two longs, a low mask and a high mask.  Taken
// together they represent a 128-bit mask, where bit i is set iff the
// character with value i is permitted.
// 
// This approach is more efficient than sequentially searching arrays of
// permitted characters.  It could be made still more efficient by
// precompiling the mask information so that a character's presence in a
// given mask could be determined by a single table lookup.
// Compute the low-order mask for the characters in the given string
