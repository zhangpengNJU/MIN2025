/**
 * Sets the datagram socket implementation factory for the
 * application. The factory can be specified only once.
 * <p>
 * When an application creates a new datagram socket, the socket
 * implementation factory's {@code createDatagramSocketImpl} method is
 * called to create the actual datagram socket implementation.
 * <p>
 * Passing {@code null} to the method is a no-op unless the factory
 * was already set.
 *
 * <p>If there is a security manager, this method first calls
 * the security manager's {@code checkSetFactory} method
 * to ensure the operation is allowed.
 * This could result in a SecurityException.
 *
 * @param      fac   the desired factory.
 * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs when setting the
 *              datagram socket factory.
 * @exception  SocketException  if the factory is already defined.
 * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its
 *             {@code checkSetFactory} method doesn't allow the
 *     operation.
