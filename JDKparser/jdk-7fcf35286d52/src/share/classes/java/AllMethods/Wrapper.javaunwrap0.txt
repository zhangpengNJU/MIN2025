/**
 * Returns an object that implements the given interface to allow access to

 *
 * If the receiver implements the interface then the result is the receiver
 * or a proxy for the receiver. If the receiver is a wrapper
 * and the wrapped object implements the interface then the result is the
 * wrapped object or a proxy for the wrapped object. Otherwise return the
 * the result of calling <code>unwrap</code> recursively on the wrapped object
 * or a proxy for that result. If the receiver is not a
 * wrapper and does not implement the interface, then an <code>SQLException</code> is thrown.

 * @param <T> the type of the class modeled by this Class object

 * @return an object that implements the interface. May be a proxy for the actual implementing object.
