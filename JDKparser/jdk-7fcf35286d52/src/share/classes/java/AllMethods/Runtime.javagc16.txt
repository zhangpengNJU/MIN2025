/**
 * Runs the garbage collector.
 * Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend
 * effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory
 * they currently occupy available for quick reuse. When control
 * returns from the method call, the virtual machine has made
 * its best effort to recycle all discarded objects.
 * <p>
 * The name <code>gc</code> stands for "garbage
 * collector". The virtual machine performs this recycling
 * process automatically as needed, in a separate thread, even if the
 * <code>gc</code> method is not invoked explicitly.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link System#gc()} is the conventional and convenient
 * means of invoking this method.
