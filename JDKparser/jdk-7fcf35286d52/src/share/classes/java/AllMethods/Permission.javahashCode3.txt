/**
 * Returns the hash code value for this Permission object.
 * <P>
 * The required {@code hashCode} behavior for Permission Objects is
 * the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Whenever it is invoked on the same Permission object more than
 *     once during an execution of a Java application, the
 *     {@code hashCode} method
 *     must consistently return the same integer. This integer need not
 *     remain consistent from one execution of an application to another
 *     execution of the same application.
 * <li>If two Permission objects are equal according to the
 *     {@code equals}
 *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the
 *     two Permission objects must produce the same integer result.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @return a hash code value for this object.
