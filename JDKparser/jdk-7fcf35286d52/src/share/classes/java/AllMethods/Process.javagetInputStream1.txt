/**
 * Returns the input stream connected to the normal output of the
 * subprocess.  The stream obtains data piped from the standard
 * output of the process represented by this {@code Process} object.
 *
 * <p>If the standard output of the subprocess has been redirected using
 * {@link ProcessBuilder#redirectOutput(Redirect)
 * ProcessBuilder.redirectOutput}
 * then this method will return a
 * <a href="ProcessBuilder.html#redirect-output">null input stream</a>.
 *
 * <p>Otherwise, if the standard error of the subprocess has been
 * redirected using
 * {@link ProcessBuilder#redirectErrorStream(boolean)
 * ProcessBuilder.redirectErrorStream}
 * then the input stream returned by this method will receive the
 * merged standard output and the standard error of the subprocess.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned
 * input stream to be buffered.
 *
 * @return the input stream connected to the normal output of the
