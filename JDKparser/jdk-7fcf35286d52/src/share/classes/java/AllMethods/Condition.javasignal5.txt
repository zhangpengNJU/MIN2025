/**
 * Wakes up one waiting thread.
 *
 * <p>If any threads are waiting on this condition then one
 * is selected for waking up. That thread must then re-acquire the
 * lock before returning from {@code await}.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
 *
 * <p>An implementation may (and typically does) require that the
 * current thread hold the lock associated with this {@code
 * Condition} when this method is called. Implementations must
 * document this precondition and any actions taken if the lock is
 * not held. Typically, an exception such as {@link
 * IllegalMonitorStateException} will be thrown.
