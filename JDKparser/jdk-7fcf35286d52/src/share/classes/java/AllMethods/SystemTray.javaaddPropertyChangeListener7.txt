/**
 * Adds a {@code PropertyChangeListener} to the list of listeners for the
 * specific property. The following properties are currently supported:
 *
 * <table border=1 summary="SystemTray properties">
 * <tr>
 *    <th>Property</th>
 *    <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>{@code trayIcons}</td>
 *    <td>The {@code SystemTray}'s array of {@code TrayIcon} objects.
 *        The array is accessed via the {@link #getTrayIcons} method.<br>
 *        This property is changed when a tray icon is added to (or removed
 *        from) the system tray.<br> For example, this property is changed
 *        when the system tray becomes unavailable on the desktop<br>
 *        and the tray icons are automatically removed.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>{@code systemTray}</td>
 *    <td>This property contains {@code SystemTray} instance when the system tray
 *        is available or <code>null</code> otherwise.<br> This property is changed
 *        when the system tray becomes available or unavailable on the desktop.<br>
 *        The property is accessed by the {@link #getSystemTray} method.</td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * The {@code listener} listens to property changes only in this context.
 * <p>
 * If {@code listener} is {@code null}, no exception is thrown
 * and no action is performed.
 *
 * @param propertyName the specified property
 * @param listener the property change listener to be added
 *
 * @see #removePropertyChangeListener
 * @see #getPropertyChangeListeners
