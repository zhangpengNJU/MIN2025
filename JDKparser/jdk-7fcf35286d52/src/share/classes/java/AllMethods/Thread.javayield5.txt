 * <p> Yield is a heuristic attempt to improve relative progression

 * should be combined with detailed profiling and benchmarking to
 * ensure that it actually has the desired effect.
 *
 * <p> It is rarely appropriate to use this method. It may be useful
 * for debugging or testing purposes, where it may help to reproduce
 * bugs due to race conditions. It may also be useful when designing
 * concurrency control constructs such as the ones in the
