/**
 * Calculates the period between this date and another date as a {@code ChronoPeriod}.
 * <p>
 * This calculates the period between two dates. All supplied chronologies
 * calculate the period using years, months and days, however the
 * {@code ChronoPeriod} API allows the period to be represented using other units.
 * <p>
 * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date.
 * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 * The negative sign will be the same in each of year, month and day.
 * <p>
 * The calculation is performed using the chronology of this date.
 * If necessary, the input date will be converted to match.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param endDateExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which may be in any chronology, not null
 * @return the period between this date and the end date, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the period cannot be calculated
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
