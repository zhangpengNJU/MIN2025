 * Sets the value of the connection's client info properties.  The
 * <code>Properties</code> object contains the names and values of the client info
 * properties to be set.  The set of client info properties contained in
 * the properties list replaces the current set of client info properties
 * on the connection.  If a property that is currently set on the
 * connection is not present in the properties list, that property is
 * cleared.  Specifying an empty properties list will clear all of the
 * properties on the connection.  See <code>setClientInfo (String, String)</code> for
 * more information.
 * <p>
 * If an error occurs in setting any of the client info properties, a
 * <code>SQLClientInfoException</code> is thrown. The <code>SQLClientInfoException</code>
 * contains information indicating which client info properties were not set.
 * The state of the client information is unknown because
 * some databases do not allow multiple client info properties to be set
 * atomically.  For those databases, one or more properties may have been
 * set before the error occurred.
