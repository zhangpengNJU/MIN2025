 * Compares this <code>RowId</code> to the specified object. The result is

 * to consider both the origin and the valid lifetime of a <code>RowId</code>
 * when comparing it to another <code>RowId</code>. If both are valid, and
 * both are from the same table on the same data source, then if they are equal
 * they identify
 * the same row; if one or more is no longer guaranteed to be valid, or if
 * they originate from different data sources, or different tables on the
 * same data source, they  may be equal but still
 * not identify the same row.
 *
 * @param obj the <code>Object</code> to compare this <code>RowId</code> object
 *     against.
 * @return true if the <code>RowId</code>s are equal; false otherwise
