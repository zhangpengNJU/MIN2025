/**
 * Returns the character offset in the original text corresponding to the next

 * corresponding to the collation element (a contracting character sequence is
 * when two or more characters all correspond to the same collation element).
 * This means if you do setOffset(x) followed immediately by getOffset(), getOffset()
 * won't necessarily return x.
