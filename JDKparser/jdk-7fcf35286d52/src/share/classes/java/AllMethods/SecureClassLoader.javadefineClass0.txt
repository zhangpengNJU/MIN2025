/**
 * Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class Class,
 * with an optional CodeSource. Before the
 * class can be used it must be resolved.
 * <p>
 * If a non-null CodeSource is supplied a ProtectionDomain is
 * constructed and associated with the class being defined.
 * <p>
 * @param      name the expected name of the class, or {@code null}
 *                  if not known, using '.' and not '/' as the separator
 *                  and without a trailing ".class" suffix.
 * @param      b    the bytes that make up the class data. The bytes in
 *             positions {@code off} through {@code off+len-1}
 *             should have the format of a valid class file as defined by
 *             <cite>The Java&trade; Virtual Machine Specification</cite>.
 * @param      off  the start offset in {@code b} of the class data
 * @param      len  the length of the class data
 * @param      cs   the associated CodeSource, or {@code null} if none
 * @return the {@code Class} object created from the data,
 *         and optional CodeSource.
 * @exception  ClassFormatError if the data did not contain a valid class
 * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException if either {@code off} or
 *             {@code len} is negative, or if
 *             {@code off+len} is greater than {@code b.length}.
 *
 * @exception  SecurityException if an attempt is made to add this class
 *             to a package that contains classes that were signed by
 *             a different set of certificates than this class, or if
 *             the class name begins with "java.".
