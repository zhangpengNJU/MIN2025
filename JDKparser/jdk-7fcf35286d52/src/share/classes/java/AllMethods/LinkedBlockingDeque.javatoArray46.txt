/**
 * Returns an array containing all of the elements in this deque, in
 * proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
 * the specified array.  If the deque fits in the specified array, it
 * is returned therein.  Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
 * runtime type of the specified array and the size of this deque.
 *
 * <p>If this deque fits in the specified array with room to spare
 * (i.e., the array has more elements than this deque), the element in
 * the array immediately following the end of the deque is set to
 * {@code null}.
 *
 * <p>Like the {@link #toArray()} method, this method acts as bridge between
 * array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
 * precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
 * under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.
 *
 * <p>Suppose {@code x} is a deque known to contain only strings.
 * The following code can be used to dump the deque into a newly
 * allocated array of {@code String}:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);}</pre>
 *
 * Note that {@code toArray(new Object[0])} is identical in function to
 * {@code toArray()}.
 *
 * @param a the array into which the elements of the deque are to
 *          be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
 *          same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
 * @return an array containing all of the elements in this deque
 * @throws ArrayStoreException if the runtime type of the specified array
 *         is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
 *         this deque
 * @throws NullPointerException if the specified array is null
