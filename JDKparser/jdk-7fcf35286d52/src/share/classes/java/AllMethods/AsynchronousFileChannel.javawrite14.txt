/**
 * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer, starting
 * at the given file position.
 *
 * <p> This method initiates the writing of a sequence of bytes to this
 * channel from the given buffer, starting at the given file position. The
 * method returns a {@code Future} representing the pending result of the
 * write operation. The {@code Future}'s {@link Future#get() get} method
 * returns the number of bytes written.
 *
 * <p> This method works in the same manner as the {@link
 * AsynchronousByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer)} method, except that bytes are
 * written starting at the given file position. If the given position is
 * greater than the file's size, at the time that the write is attempted,
 * then the file will be grown to accommodate the new bytes; the values of
 * any bytes between the previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes
 * are unspecified.
 *
 * @param   src
 *          The buffer from which bytes are to be transferred
 * @param   position
 *          The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
 *          must be non-negative
 *
 * @return  A {@code Future} object representing the pending result
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the position is negative
 * @throws  NonWritableChannelException
 *          If this channel was not opened for writing
