/**
 * Registers a listener for PropertyChange events on the properties map.

 * @param listener  An object to be invoked when a property is changed.
 * @deprecated The dependency on {@code PropertyChangeListener} creates
 *             a significant impediment to future modularization of the
 *             Java platform. This method will be removed in a future
 *             release.
 *             Applications that need to monitor progress of the
 *             unpacker can poll the value of the {@link #PROGRESS
 *             PROGRESS} property instead.
