/**

 * @deprecated This method was originally designed to force a thread to stop
 *        and throw a given {@code Throwable} as an exception. It was
 *        inherently unsafe (see {@link #stop()} for details), and furthermore
 *        could be used to generate exceptions that the target thread was
 *        not prepared to handle.
 *        For more information, see
 *        <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">Why
 *        are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?</a>.
