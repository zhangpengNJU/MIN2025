/**
 * Binds the channel's socket to a local address.
 *
 * <p> This method is used to establish an association between the socket and
 * a local address. Once an association is established then the socket remains
 * bound until the channel is closed. If the {@code local} parameter has the
 * value {@code null} then the socket will be bound to an address that is
 * assigned automatically.
 *
 * @param   local
 *          The address to bind the socket, or {@code null} to bind the socket
 *          to an automatically assigned socket address
 *
 * @return  This channel
 *
 * @throws  AlreadyBoundException
 *          If the socket is already bound
 * @throws  UnsupportedAddressTypeException
 *          If the type of the given address is not supported
 * @throws  ClosedChannelException
 *          If the channel is closed
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If some other I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
 *          permission. An implementation of this interface should specify
 *          any required permissions.
