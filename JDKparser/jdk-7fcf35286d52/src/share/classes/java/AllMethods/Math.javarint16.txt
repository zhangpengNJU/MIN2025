/**
 * Returns the {@code double} value that is closest in value

 * even. Special cases:
 * <ul><li>If the argument value is already equal to a mathematical
 * integer, then the result is the same as the argument.
 * <li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity or positive zero or negative
 * zero, then the result is the same as the argument.</ul>
 *
 * @param   a   a {@code double} value.
 * @return  the closest floating-point value to {@code a} that is
 *          equal to a mathematical integer.
