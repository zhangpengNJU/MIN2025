/**
 * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffers.

 *
 * @param  srcs
 *         The buffers from which bytes are to be retrieved
 *
 * @return  The number of bytes written, possibly zero
 *
 * @throws  NonWritableChannelException
 *          If this channel was not opened for writing
 *
 * @throws  ClosedChannelException
 *          If this channel is closed
 *
 * @throws  AsynchronousCloseException
 *          If another thread closes this channel
 *          while the write operation is in progress

 * @throws  ClosedByInterruptException
 *          If another thread interrupts the current thread
 *          while the write operation is in progress, thereby
 *          closing the channel and setting the current thread's
 *          interrupt status
 *
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If some other I/O error occurs
