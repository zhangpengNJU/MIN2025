 * Parsing can be strict or lenient - by default its strict.

 * When used, this method changes the parsing to be strict from this point onwards.
 * As strict is the default, this is normally only needed after calling {@link #parseLenient()}.
 * The change will remain in force until the end of the formatter that is eventually
 * constructed or until {@code parseLenient} is called.
