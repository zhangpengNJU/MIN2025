/**
 * Returns a field to access the day of week based on this {@code WeekFields}.
 * <p>
 * This is similar to {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK} but uses values for
 * the day-of-week based on this {@code WeekFields}.
 * The days are numbered from 1 to 7 where the
 * {@link #getFirstDayOfWeek() first day-of-week} is assigned the value 1.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the first day-of-week is Sunday, then that will have the
 * value 1, with other days ranging from Monday as 2 to Saturday as 7.
 * <p>
 * In the resolving phase of parsing, a localized day-of-week will be converted
 * to a standardized {@code ChronoField} day-of-week.
 * The day-of-week must be in the valid range 1 to 7.
 * Other fields in this class build dates using the standardized day-of-week.
 *
 * @return a field providing access to the day-of-week with localized numbering, not null
