/**
 * Returns the previous-or-same day-of-week adjuster, which adjusts the date to the
 * first occurrence of the specified day-of-week before the date being adjusted
 * unless it is already on that day in which case the same object is returned.
 * <p>
 * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
 * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (MONDAY) will return 2011-01-10 (five days earlier).<br>
 * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (WEDNESDAY) will return 2011-01-12 (three days earlier).<br>
 * The input 2011-01-15 (a Saturday) for parameter (SATURDAY) will return 2011-01-15 (same as input).
 * <p>
 * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
 * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} field and the {@code DAYS} unit,
 * and assumes a seven day week.
 *
 * @param dayOfWeek  the day-of-week to check for or move the date to, not null
 * @return the previous-or-same day-of-week adjuster, not null
