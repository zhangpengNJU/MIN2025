/**

 * consider to be their
 * canonical form. For example, two FilePermission objects created via
 * the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   perm1 = new FilePermission(p1,"read,write");
 *   perm2 = new FilePermission(p2,"write,read");
 * </pre>
 *
 * both return
 * "read,write" when the {@code getActions} method is invoked.
 *
 * @return the actions of this Permission.
