 * signature will have already been written to the stream.  This method may
 * make free use of the ObjectOutputStream to save any representation of
 * the class it deems suitable (for example, the bytes of the class file).
 * The resolveClass method in the corresponding subclass of
 * ObjectInputStream must read and use any data or objects written by
 * annotateClass.
