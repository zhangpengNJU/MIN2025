// As soon as the Entry is put into the cache, the value will be
// reachable via a data race (as defined by the Java Memory Model).
// This race is benign, assuming the value object itself can be
// read safely by multiple threads.  This is up to the user.
// 
// The entry and version fields themselves can be safely read via
// a race because they are either final or have controlled states.
// If the pointer from the entry to the version is still null,
// or if the version goes immediately dead and is nulled out,
// the reader will take the slow path and retry under a lock.
