/**
 * Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of

 * this {@code String} object, then the index (in Unicode
 * code units) of the first such occurrence is returned. For
 * values of {@code ch} in the range from 0 to 0xFFFF
 * (inclusive), this is the smallest value <i>k</i> such that:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * this.charAt(<i>k</i>) == ch
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * is true. For other values of {@code ch}, it is the
 * smallest value <i>k</i> such that:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * this.codePointAt(<i>k</i>) == ch
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this
 * string, then {@code -1} is returned.
 *
 * @param   ch   a character (Unicode code point).
 * @return  the index of the first occurrence of the character in the
 *          character sequence represented by this object, or
 *          {@code -1} if the character does not occur.
