/**
 * Retrieves the name of the SQL cursor used by this <code>ResultSet</code>
 * object.
 *
 * <P>In SQL, a result table is retrieved through a cursor that is
 * named. The current row of a result set can be updated or deleted
 * using a positioned update/delete statement that references the
 * cursor name. To insure that the cursor has the proper isolation
 * level to support update, the cursor's <code>SELECT</code> statement
 * should be of the form <code>SELECT FOR UPDATE</code>. If
 * <code>FOR UPDATE</code> is omitted, the positioned updates may fail.
 *
 * <P>The JDBC API supports this SQL feature by providing the name of the
 * SQL cursor used by a <code>ResultSet</code> object.
 * The current row of a <code>ResultSet</code> object
 * is also the current row of this SQL cursor.
 *
 * @return the SQL name for this <code>ResultSet</code> object's cursor
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
