/**
 * Converts the argument to an {@code int} by an unsigned
 * conversion.  In an unsigned conversion to an {@code int}, the
 * high-order 16 bits of the {@code int} are zero and the
 * low-order 16 bits are equal to the bits of the {@code short} argument.
 *
 * Consequently, zero and positive {@code short} values are mapped
 * to a numerically equal {@code int} value and negative {@code
 * short} values are mapped to an {@code int} value equal to the
 * input plus 2<sup>16</sup>.
 *
 * @param  x the value to convert to an unsigned {@code int}
 * @return the argument converted to {@code int} by an unsigned
 *         conversion
