/**
 * Returns the current thread's "initial value" for this
 * thread-local variable.  This method will be invoked the first
 * time a thread accesses the variable with the {@link #get}
 * method, unless the thread previously invoked the {@link #set}
 * method, in which case the {@code initialValue} method will not
 * be invoked for the thread.  Normally, this method is invoked at
 * most once per thread, but it may be invoked again in case of
 * subsequent invocations of {@link #remove} followed by {@link #get}.
 *
 * <p>This implementation simply returns {@code null}; if the
 * programmer desires thread-local variables to have an initial
 * value other than {@code null}, {@code ThreadLocal} must be
 * subclassed, and this method overridden.  Typically, an
 * anonymous inner class will be used.
