/**
 * Returns the number of data elements needed to transfer a pixel
 *  via the getDataElements and setDataElements methods.  When pixels
 *  are transferred via these methods, they may be transferred in a
 *  packed or unpacked format, depending on the implementation of the
 *  SampleModel.  Using these methods, pixels are transferred as an
 *  array of getNumDataElements() elements of a primitive type given
 *  by getTransferType().  The TransferType may or may not be the same
 *  as the storage DataType.
 *  @return the number of data elements.
