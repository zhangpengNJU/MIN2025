/**
 * Returns a string representation of the {@code long}
 * argument as an unsigned integer in base&nbsp;2.
 *
 * <p>The unsigned {@code long} value is the argument plus
 * 2<sup>64</sup> if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is
 * equal to the argument.  This value is converted to a string of
 * ASCII digits in binary (base&nbsp;2) with no extra leading
 * {@code 0}s.
 *
 * <p>The value of the argument can be recovered from the returned
 * string {@code s} by calling {@link
 * Long#parseUnsignedLong(String, int) Long.parseUnsignedLong(s,
 * 2)}.
 *
 * <p>If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a
 * single zero character {@code '0'} ({@code '\u005Cu0030'});
 * otherwise, the first character of the representation of the
 * unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The
 * characters {@code '0'} ({@code '\u005Cu0030'}) and {@code
 * '1'} ({@code '\u005Cu0031'}) are used as binary digits.
 *
 * @param   i   a {@code long} to be converted to a string.
 * @return  the string representation of the unsigned {@code long}
 *          value represented by the argument in binary (base&nbsp;2).
 * @see #parseUnsignedLong(String, int)
