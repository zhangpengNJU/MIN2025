/**
 * Resolve the given path against this path.
 *
 * <p> If the {@code other} parameter is an {@link #isAbsolute() absolute}
 * path then this method trivially returns {@code other}. If {@code other}
 * is an <i>empty path</i> then this method trivially returns this path.
 * Otherwise this method considers this path to be a directory and resolves
 * the given path against this path. In the simplest case, the given path
 * does not have a {@link #getRoot root} component, in which case this method
 * <em>joins</em> the given path to this path and returns a resulting path
 * that {@link #endsWith ends} with the given path. Where the given path has
 * a root component then resolution is highly implementation dependent and
 * therefore unspecified.
 *
 * @param   other
 *          the path to resolve against this path
 *
 * @return  the resulting path
 *
 * @see #relativize
