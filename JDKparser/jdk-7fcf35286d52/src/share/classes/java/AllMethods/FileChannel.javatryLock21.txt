/**
 * Attempts to acquire a lock on the given region of this channel's file.
 *
 * <p> This method does not block.  An invocation always returns
 * immediately, either having acquired a lock on the requested region or
 * having failed to do so.  If it fails to acquire a lock because an
 * overlapping lock is held by another program then it returns
 * <tt>null</tt>.  If it fails to acquire a lock for any other reason then
 * an appropriate exception is thrown.
 *
 * <p> The region specified by the <tt>position</tt> and <tt>size</tt>
 * parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual
 * underlying file.  Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region
 * initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the
 * region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock.
 * If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is
 * required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the
 * expected maximum size of the file, should be locked.  The zero-argument
 * {@link #tryLock()} method simply locks a region of size {@link
 * Long#MAX_VALUE}.
 *
 * <p> Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a
 * request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for
 * an exclusive lock.  Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or
 * exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object's {@link
 * FileLock#isShared() isShared} method.
 *
 * <p> File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine.
 * They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple
 * threads within the same virtual machine.  </p>
 *
 * @param  position
 *         The position at which the locked region is to start; must be
 *         non-negative
 *
 * @param  size
 *         The size of the locked region; must be non-negative, and the sum
 *         <tt>position</tt>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<tt>size</tt> must be non-negative
 *
 * @param  shared
 *         <tt>true</tt> to request a shared lock,
 *         <tt>false</tt> to request an exclusive lock
 *
 * @return  A lock object representing the newly-acquired lock,
 *          or <tt>null</tt> if the lock could not be acquired
 *          because another program holds an overlapping lock
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the preconditions on the parameters do not hold
 *
 * @throws  ClosedChannelException
 *          If this channel is closed
 *
 * @throws  OverlappingFileLockException
 *          If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by
 *          this Java virtual machine, or if another thread is already
 *          blocked in this method and is attempting to lock an overlapping
 *          region of the same file
 *
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If some other I/O error occurs
