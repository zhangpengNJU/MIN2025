 * inline with normal data.
 * <p>
 * Note, only limited support is provided for handling incoming urgent
 * data. In particular, no notification of incoming urgent data is provided
 * and there is no capability to distinguish between normal data and urgent
 * data unless provided by a higher level protocol.
 *
 * @param on {@code true} to enable
 *           {@link SocketOptions#SO_OOBINLINE SO_OOBINLINE},
