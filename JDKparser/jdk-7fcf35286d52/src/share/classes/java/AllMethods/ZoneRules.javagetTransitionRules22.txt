/**
 * Gets the list of transition rules for years beyond those defined in the transition list.
 * <p>
 * The complete set of transitions for this rules instance is defined by this method
 * and {@link #getTransitions()}. This method returns instances of {@link ZoneOffsetTransitionRule}
 * that define an algorithm for when transitions will occur.
 * <p>
 * For any given {@code ZoneRules}, this list contains the transition rules for years
 * beyond those years that have been fully defined. These rules typically refer to future
 * daylight saving time rule changes.
 * <p>
 * If the zone defines daylight savings into the future, then the list will normally
 * be of size two and hold information about entering and exiting daylight savings.
 * If the zone does not have daylight savings, or information about future changes
 * is uncertain, then the list will be empty.
 * <p>
 * The list will be empty for fixed offset rules and for any time-zone where there is no
 * daylight saving time. The list will also be empty if the transition rules are unknown.
 *
 * @return an immutable list of transition rules, not null
