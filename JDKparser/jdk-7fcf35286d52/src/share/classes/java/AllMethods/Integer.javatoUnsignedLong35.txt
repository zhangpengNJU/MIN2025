/**
 * Converts the argument to a {@code long} by an unsigned
 * conversion.  In an unsigned conversion to a {@code long}, the
 * high-order 32 bits of the {@code long} are zero and the
 * low-order 32 bits are equal to the bits of the integer
 * argument.
 *
 * Consequently, zero and positive {@code int} values are mapped
 * to a numerically equal {@code long} value and negative {@code
 * int} values are mapped to a {@code long} value equal to the
 * input plus 2<sup>32</sup>.
 *
 * @param  x the value to convert to an unsigned {@code long}
 * @return the argument converted to {@code long} by an unsigned
 *         conversion
