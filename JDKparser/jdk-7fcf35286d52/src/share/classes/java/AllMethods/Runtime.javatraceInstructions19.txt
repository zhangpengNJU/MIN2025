/**
 * Enables/Disables tracing of instructions.

 * output stream to which it is emitted, depends on the host environment.
 * The virtual machine may ignore this request if it does not support
 * this feature. The destination of the trace output is system
 * dependent.
 * <p>
 * If the <code>boolean</code> argument is <code>false</code>, this
 * method causes the virtual machine to stop performing the
 * detailed instruction trace it is performing.
 *
 * @param   on   <code>true</code> to enable instruction tracing;
 *               <code>false</code> to disable this feature.
