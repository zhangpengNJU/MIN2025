/**
 * This method is called by the AWT event dispatcher requesting that the
 * current KeyboardFocusManager dispatch the specified event on its behalf.
 * It is expected that all KeyboardFocusManagers will dispatch all
 * FocusEvents, all WindowEvents related to focus, and all KeyEvents.
 * These events should be dispatched based on the KeyboardFocusManager's
 * notion of the focus owner and the focused and active Windows, sometimes
 * overriding the source of the specified AWTEvent. Dispatching must be
 * done using <code>redispatchEvent</code> to prevent the AWT event
 * dispatcher from recursively requesting that the KeyboardFocusManager
 * dispatch the event again. If this method returns <code>false</code>,
 * then the AWT event dispatcher will attempt to dispatch the event itself.
 *
 * @param e the AWTEvent to be dispatched
 * @return <code>true</code> if this method dispatched the event;
 *         <code>false</code> otherwise
 * @see #redispatchEvent
 * @see #dispatchKeyEvent
