/**
 * Returns the array that backs this
 * buffer&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(optional operation)</i>.
 *
 * <p> This method is intended to allow array-backed buffers to be
 * passed to native code more efficiently. Concrete subclasses
 * provide more strongly-typed return values for this method.
 *
 * <p> Modifications to this buffer's content will cause the returned
 * array's content to be modified, and vice versa.
 *
 * <p> Invoke the {@link #hasArray hasArray} method before invoking this
 * method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
 * array.  </p>
 *
 * @return  The array that backs this buffer
 *
 * @throws  ReadOnlyBufferException
 *          If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
 *
 * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
 *          If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array
 *
 * @since 1.6
