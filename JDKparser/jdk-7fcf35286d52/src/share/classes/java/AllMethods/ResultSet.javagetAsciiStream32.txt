/**
 * Retrieves the value of the designated column in the current row
 * of this <code>ResultSet</code> object as a stream of
 * ASCII characters. The value can then be read in chunks from the
 * stream. This method is particularly
 * suitable for retrieving large <code>LONGVARCHAR</code> values.
 * The JDBC driver will
 * do any necessary conversion from the database format into ASCII.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> All the data in the returned stream must be
 * read prior to getting the value of any other column. The next
 * call to a getter method implicitly closes the stream. Also, a
 * stream may return <code>0</code> when the method <code>available</code>
 * is called whether there is data available or not.
 *
 * @param columnLabel the label for the column specified with the SQL AS clause.  If the SQL AS clause was not specified, then the label is the name of the column
 * @return a Java input stream that delivers the database column value
 * as a stream of one-byte ASCII characters.
 * If the value is SQL <code>NULL</code>,
 * the value returned is <code>null</code>.
 * @exception SQLException if the columnLabel is not valid;
 * if a database access error occurs or this method is
 *            called on a closed result set
