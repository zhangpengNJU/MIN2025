/**
 * Attempts to restore the drawing surface of the image if the surface
 * had been lost since the last <code>validate</code> call.  Also
 * validates this image against the given GraphicsConfiguration
 * parameter to see whether operations from this image to the
 * GraphicsConfiguration are compatible.  An example of an
 * incompatible combination might be a situation where a VolatileImage
 * object was created on one graphics device and then was used
 * to render to a different graphics device.  Since VolatileImage
 * objects tend to be very device-specific, this operation might
 * not work as intended, so the return code from this validate
 * call would note that incompatibility.  A null or incorrect
 * value for gc may cause incorrect values to be returned from
 * <code>validate</code> and may cause later problems with rendering.
 *
 * @param   gc   a <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code> object for this
 *          image to be validated against.  A null gc implies that the
 *          validate method should skip the compatibility test.
 * @return  <code>IMAGE_OK</code> if the image did not need validation<BR>
 *          <code>IMAGE_RESTORED</code> if the image needed restoration.
 *          Restoration implies that the contents of the image may have
 *          been affected and the image may need to be re-rendered.<BR>
 *          <code>IMAGE_INCOMPATIBLE</code> if the image is incompatible
 *          with the <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code> object passed
 *          into the <code>validate</code> method.  Incompatibility
 *          implies that the image may need to be recreated with a
 *          new <code>Component</code> or
 *          <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code> in order to get an image
 *          that can be used successfully with this
 *          <code>GraphicsConfiguration</code>.
 *          An incompatible image is not checked for whether restoration
 *          was necessary, so the state of the image is unchanged
 *          after a return value of <code>IMAGE_INCOMPATIBLE</code>
 *          and this return value implies nothing about whether the
 *          image needs to be restored.
