 * Returns whether the drawing buffer was recently restored from a lost

 * Since the buffers in a buffer strategy are usually type
 * <code>VolatileImage</code>, they may become lost.  If a surface has
 * been recently restored from a lost state since the last call to
 * <code>getDrawGraphics</code>, it may require repainting.
 * For a discussion on lost buffers, see <code>VolatileImage</code>.

 * @return Whether or not the drawing buffer was restored since the last
