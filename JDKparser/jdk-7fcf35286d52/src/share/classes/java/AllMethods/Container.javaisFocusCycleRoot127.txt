/**
 * Returns whether this Container is the root of a focus traversal cycle.
 * Once focus enters a traversal cycle, typically it cannot leave it via
 * focus traversal unless one of the up- or down-cycle keys is pressed.
 * Normal traversal is limited to this Container, and all of this
 * Container's descendants that are not descendants of inferior focus
 * cycle roots. Note that a FocusTraversalPolicy may bend these
 * restrictions, however. For example, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy
 * supports implicit down-cycle traversal.
