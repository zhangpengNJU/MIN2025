/**
 * Returns a {@code Collection} of {@code Certificate}s that

 * match the selector, an empty {@code Collection} will be returned.
 * <p>
 * For some {@code CertStore} types, the resulting
 * {@code Collection} may not contain <b>all</b> of the
 * {@code Certificate}s that match the selector. For instance,
 * an LDAP {@code CertStore} may not search all entries in the
 * directory. Instead, it may just search entries that are likely to
 * contain the {@code Certificate}s it is looking for.
 * <p>
 * Some {@code CertStore} implementations (especially LDAP
 * {@code CertStore}s) may throw a {@code CertStoreException}
 * unless a non-null {@code CertSelector} is provided that includes
 * specific criteria that can be used to find the certificates. Issuer
 * and/or subject names are especially useful criteria.
 *
 * @param selector A {@code CertSelector} used to select which
 *  {@code Certificate}s should be returned. Specify {@code null}
 *  to return all {@code Certificate}s (if supported).
 * @return A {@code Collection} of {@code Certificate}s that
 *         match the specified selector (never {@code null})
 * @throws CertStoreException if an exception occurs
