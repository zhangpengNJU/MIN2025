/**
 * Draws as much of the specified image as has already been scaled
 * to fit inside the specified rectangle.
 * <p>
 * The image is drawn inside the specified rectangle of this
 * graphics context's coordinate space, and is scaled if
 * necessary. Transparent pixels are drawn in the specified
 * background color.
 * This operation is equivalent to filling a rectangle of the
 * width and height of the specified image with the given color and then
 * drawing the image on top of it, but possibly more efficient.
 * <p>
 * This method returns immediately in all cases, even if the
 * entire image has not yet been scaled, dithered, and converted
 * for the current output device.
 * If the current output representation is not yet complete then
 * <code>drawImage</code> returns <code>false</code>. As more of
 * the image becomes available, the process that loads the image notifies
 * the specified image observer.
 * <p>
 * A scaled version of an image will not necessarily be
 * available immediately just because an unscaled version of the
 * image has been constructed for this output device.  Each size of
 * the image may be cached separately and generated from the original
 * data in a separate image production sequence.
 * @param    img       the specified image to be drawn. This method does
 *                     nothing if <code>img</code> is null.
 * @param    x         the <i>x</i> coordinate.
 * @param    y         the <i>y</i> coordinate.
 * @param    width     the width of the rectangle.
 * @param    height    the height of the rectangle.
 * @param    bgcolor   the background color to paint under the
 *                         non-opaque portions of the image.
 * @param    observer    object to be notified as more of
 *                          the image is converted.
 * @return   <code>false</code> if the image pixels are still changing;
 *           <code>true</code> otherwise.
 * @see      java.awt.Image
