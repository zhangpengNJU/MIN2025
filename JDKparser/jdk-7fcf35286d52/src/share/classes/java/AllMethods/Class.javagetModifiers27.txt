/**
 * Returns the Java language modifiers for this class or interface, encoded
 * in an integer. The modifiers consist of the Java Virtual Machine's
 * constants for {@code public}, {@code protected},
 * {@code private}, {@code final}, {@code static},
 * {@code abstract} and {@code interface}; they should be decoded
 * using the methods of class {@code Modifier}.
 *
 * <p> If the underlying class is an array class, then its
 * {@code public}, {@code private} and {@code protected}
 * modifiers are the same as those of its component type.  If this
 * {@code Class} represents a primitive type or void, its
 * {@code public} modifier is always {@code true}, and its
 * {@code protected} and {@code private} modifiers are always
 * {@code false}. If this object represents an array class, a
 * primitive type or void, then its {@code final} modifier is always
 * {@code true} and its interface modifier is always
 * {@code false}. The values of its other modifiers are not determined
 * by this specification.
 *
 * <p> The modifier encodings are defined in <em>The Java Virtual Machine
 * Specification</em>, table 4.1.
 *
 * @return the {@code int} representing the modifiers for this class
 * @see     java.lang.reflect.Modifier
