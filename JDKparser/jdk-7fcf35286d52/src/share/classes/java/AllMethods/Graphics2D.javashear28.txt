/**
 * Concatenates the current <code>Graphics2D</code>

 * This is equivalent to calling <code>transform(SH)</code>, where SH
 * is an <code>AffineTransform</code> represented by the following
 * matrix:
 * <pre>
 *          [   1   shx   0   ]
 *          [  shy   1    0   ]
 *          [   0    0    1   ]
 * </pre>
 * @param shx the multiplier by which coordinates are shifted in
 * the positive X axis direction as a function of their Y coordinate
 * @param shy the multiplier by which coordinates are shifted in
 * the positive Y axis direction as a function of their X coordinate
