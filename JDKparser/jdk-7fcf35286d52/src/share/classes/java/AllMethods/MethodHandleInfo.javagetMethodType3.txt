/**
 * Returns the nominal type of the cracked symbolic reference, expressed as a method type.
 * If the reference is to a constructor, the return type will be {@code void}.
 * If it is to a non-static method, the method type will not mention the {@code this} parameter.
 * If it is to a field and the requested access is to read the field,
 * the method type will have no parameters and return the field type.
 * If it is to a field and the requested access is to write the field,
 * the method type will have one parameter of the field type and return {@code void}.
 * <p>
 * Note that original direct method handle may include a leading {@code this} parameter,
 * or (in the case of a constructor) will replace the {@code void} return type
 * with the constructed class.
 * The nominal type does not include any {@code this} parameter,
 * and (in the case of a constructor) will return {@code void}.
 * @return the type of the underlying member, expressed as a method type
