/**
 * Sorts the specified array of objects into ascending order, according
 * to the {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} of its elements.
 * All elements in the array must implement the {@link Comparable}
 * interface.  Furthermore, all elements in the array must be
 * <i>mutually comparable</i> (that is, {@code e1.compareTo(e2)} must
 * not throw a {@code ClassCastException} for any elements {@code e1}
 * and {@code e2} in the array).
 *
 * <p>This sort is guaranteed to be <i>stable</i>:  equal elements will
 * not be reordered as a result of the sort.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: This implementation is a stable, adaptive,
 * iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than n lg(n) comparisons
 * when the input array is partially sorted, while offering the
 * performance of a traditional mergesort when the input array is
 * randomly ordered.  If the input array is nearly sorted, the
 * implementation requires approximately n comparisons.  Temporary
 * storage requirements vary from a small constant for nearly sorted
 * input arrays to n/2 object references for randomly ordered input
 * arrays.
 *
 * <p>The implementation takes equal advantage of ascending and
 * descending order in its input array, and can take advantage of
 * ascending and descending order in different parts of the the same
 * input array.  It is well-suited to merging two or more sorted arrays:
 * simply concatenate the arrays and sort the resulting array.
 *
 * <p>The implementation was adapted from Tim Peters's list sort for Python
 * (<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt">
 * TimSort</a>).  It uses techniques from Peter McIlroy's "Optimistic
 * Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity", in Proceedings of the
 * Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp 467-474,
 * January 1993.
 *
 * @param a the array to be sorted
 * @throws ClassCastException if the array contains elements that are not
 *         <i>mutually comparable</i> (for example, strings and integers)
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException (optional) if the natural
 *         ordering of the array elements is found to violate the
 *         {@link Comparable} contract
