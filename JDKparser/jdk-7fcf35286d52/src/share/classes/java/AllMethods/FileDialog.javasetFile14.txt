/**
 * Sets the selected file for this file dialog window to be the
 * specified file. This file becomes the default file if it is set
 * before the file dialog window is first shown.
 * <p>
 * When the dialog is shown, the specified file is selected. The kind of
 * selection depends on the file existence, the dialog type, and the native
 * platform. E.g., the file could be highlighted in the file list, or a
 * file name editbox could be populated with the file name.
 * <p>
 * This method accepts either a full file path, or a file name with an
 * extension if used together with the {@code setDirectory} method.
 * <p>
 * Specifying "" as the file is exactly equivalent to specifying
 * {@code null} as the file.
 *
 * @param    file   the file being set
 * @see      #getFile
