/**
 * Returns a copy of this {@code ZonedDateTime} with the specified number of hours subtracted.
 * <p>
 * This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one hour will
 * always be a duration of one hour earlier.
 * This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
 * Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
 * thus subtracting one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.
 * <p>
 * For example, consider a time-zone where the spring DST cutover means that the
 * local times 01:00 to 01:59 occur twice changing from offset +02:00 to +01:00.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Subtracting one hour from 02:30+01:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
 * <li>Subtracting one hour from 01:30+01:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
 * <li>Subtracting one hour from 01:30+02:00 will result in 00:30+01:00
 * <li>Subtracting three hours from 02:30+01:00 will result in 00:30+02:00
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param hours  the hours to subtract, may be negative
 * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the hours subtracted, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
