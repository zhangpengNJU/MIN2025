/**
 * Writes this object to the given SQL data stream, converting it back to
 * its SQL value in the data source.
 * The implementation of the method must follow this protocol:<BR>
 * It must write each of the attributes of the SQL type
 * to the given output stream.  This is done by calling a
 * method of the output stream to write each item, in the order that
 * they appear in the SQL definition of the type.
 * Specifically, it must call the appropriate <code>SQLOutput</code> writer
 * method(s) (<code>writeInt</code>, <code>writeString</code>, and so on)
 * to do the following: for a Distinct Type, write its single data element;
 * for a Structured Type, write a value for each attribute of the SQL type.
 *
 * @param stream the <code>SQLOutput</code> object to which to write the data for
 * the value that was custom mapped
 * @exception SQLException if there is a database access error
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
 * @see SQLOutput
 * @since 1.2
