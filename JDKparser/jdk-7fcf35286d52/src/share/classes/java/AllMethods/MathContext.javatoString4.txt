/**
 * Returns the string representation of this {@code MathContext}.
 * The {@code String} returned represents the settings of the
 * {@code MathContext} object as two space-delimited words
 * (separated by a single space character, <tt>'&#92;u0020'</tt>,
 * and with no leading or trailing white space), as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * The string {@code "precision="}, immediately followed
 * by the value of the precision setting as a numeric string as if
 * generated by the {@link Integer#toString(int) Integer.toString}
 * method.
 *
 * <li>
 * The string {@code "roundingMode="}, immediately
 * followed by the value of the {@code roundingMode} setting as a
 * word.  This word will be the same as the name of the
 * corresponding public constant in the {@link RoundingMode}
 * enum.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * precision=9 roundingMode=HALF_UP
 * </pre>
 *
 * Additional words may be appended to the result of
 * {@code toString} in the future if more properties are added to
 * this class.
 *
 * @return a {@code String} representing the context settings
