/**
 * Determines whether the character is mirrored according to the
 * Unicode specification.  Mirrored characters should have their
 * glyphs horizontally mirrored when displayed in text that is
 * right-to-left.  For example, {@code '\u005Cu0028'} LEFT
 * PARENTHESIS is semantically defined to be an <i>opening
 * parenthesis</i>.  This will appear as a "(" in text that is
 * left-to-right but as a ")" in text that is right-to-left.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This method cannot handle <a
 * href="#supplementary"> supplementary characters</a>. To support
 * all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
 * the {@link #isMirrored(int)} method.
 *
 * @param  ch {@code char} for which the mirrored property is requested
 * @return {@code true} if the char is mirrored, {@code false}
 *         if the {@code char} is not mirrored or is not defined.
