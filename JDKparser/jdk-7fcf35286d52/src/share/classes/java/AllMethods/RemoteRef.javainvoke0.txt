/**
 * Invoke a method. This form of delegating method invocation
 * to the reference allows the reference to take care of
 * setting up the connection to the remote host, marshaling
 * some representation for the method and parameters, then
 * communicating the method invocation to the remote host.
 * This method either returns the result of a method invocation
 * on the remote object which resides on the remote host or
 * throws a RemoteException if the call failed or an
 * application-level exception if the remote invocation throws
 * an exception.
 *
 * @param obj the object that contains the RemoteRef (e.g., the
 *            RemoteStub for the object.
 * @param method the method to be invoked
 * @param params the parameter list
 * @param opnum  a hash that may be used to represent the method
 * @return result of remote method invocation
 * @exception Exception if any exception occurs during remote method
 * invocation
 * @since 1.2
