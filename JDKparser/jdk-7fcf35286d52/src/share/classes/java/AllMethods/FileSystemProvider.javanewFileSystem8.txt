/**
 * Constructs a new {@code FileSystem} to access the contents of a file as a
 * file system.
 *
 * <p> This method is intended for specialized providers of pseudo file
 * systems where the contents of one or more files is treated as a file
 * system. The {@code env} parameter is a map of provider specific properties
 * to configure the file system.
 *
 * <p> If this provider does not support the creation of such file systems
 * or if the provider does not recognize the file type of the given file then
 * it throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. The default implementation
 * of this method throws {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * @param   path
 *          The path to the file
 * @param   env
 *          A map of provider specific properties to configure the file system;
 *          may be empty
 *
 * @return  A new file system
 *
 * @throws  UnsupportedOperationException
 *          If this provider does not support access to the contents as a
 *          file system or it does not recognize the file type of the
 *          given file
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the {@code env} parameter does not contain properties required
 *          by the provider, or a property value is invalid
 * @throws  IOException
 *          If an I/O error occurs
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
 *          permission.
