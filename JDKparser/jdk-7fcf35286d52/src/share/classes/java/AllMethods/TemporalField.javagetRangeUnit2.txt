/**
 * Gets the range that the field is bound by.
 * <p>
 * The range of the field is the period that the field varies within.
 * For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
 * See also {@link #getBaseUnit()}.
 * <p>
 * The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
 * 'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.
 *
 * @return the unit defining the range of the field, not null
