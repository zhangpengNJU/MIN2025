/**
 *  Releases this <code>ResultSet</code> object's database and

 *  this to happen when it is automatically closed.
 *
 *  <P>The closing of a <code>ResultSet</code> object does <strong>not</strong> close the <code>Blob</code>,
 *  <code>Clob</code> or <code>NClob</code> objects created by the <code>ResultSet</code>. <code>Blob</code>,
 *  <code>Clob</code> or <code>NClob</code> objects remain valid for at least the duration of the
 *  transaction in which they are created, unless their <code>free</code> method is invoked.
 * <p>
 *  When a <code>ResultSet</code> is closed, any <code>ResultSetMetaData</code>
 *  instances that were created by calling the  <code>getMetaData</code>
 *  method remain accessible.
 *
 *  <P><B>Note:</B> A <code>ResultSet</code> object
 *  is automatically closed by the
 *  <code>Statement</code> object that generated it when
 *  that <code>Statement</code> object is closed,
 *  re-executed, or is used to retrieve the next result from a
 *  sequence of multiple results.
 * <p>
 *  Calling the method <code>close</code> on a <code>ResultSet</code>
 *  object that is already closed is a no-op.

 *  @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs
