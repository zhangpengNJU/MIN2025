 * Updates the designated column using the given <code>Reader</code>

 * The updater methods are used to update column values in the
 * current row or the insert row.  The updater methods do not
 * update the underlying database; instead the <code>updateRow</code> or
 * <code>insertRow</code> methods are called to update the database.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> Consult your JDBC driver documentation to determine if
 * it might be more efficient to use a version of
 * <code>updateNClob</code> which takes a length parameter.
