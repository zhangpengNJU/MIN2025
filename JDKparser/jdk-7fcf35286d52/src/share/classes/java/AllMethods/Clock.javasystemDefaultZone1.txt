/**
 * Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available
 * system clock, converting to date and time using the default time-zone.
 * <p>
 * This clock is based on the best available system clock.
 * This may use {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, or a higher resolution
 * clock if one is available.
 * <p>
 * Using this method hard codes a dependency to the default time-zone into your application.
 * It is recommended to avoid this and use a specific time-zone whenever possible.
 * The {@link #systemUTC() UTC clock} should be used when you need the current instant
 * without the date or time.
 * <p>
 * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
 * It is equivalent to {@code system(ZoneId.systemDefault())}.
 *
 * @return a clock that uses the best available system clock in the default zone, not null
 * @see ZoneId#systemDefault()
