/**
 * Returns a (possibly empty) collection view of the certificates read
 * from the given input stream {@code inStream}.
 *
 * <p>In order to take advantage of the specialized certificate format
 * supported by this certificate factory, each element in
 * the returned collection view can be typecast to the corresponding
 * certificate class. For example, if this certificate
 * factory implements X.509 certificates, the elements in the returned
 * collection can be typecast to the {@code X509Certificate} class.
 *
 * <p>In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates,
 * {@code inStream} may contain a sequence of DER-encoded certificates
 * in the formats described for
 * {@link #generateCertificate(java.io.InputStream) generateCertificate}.
 * In addition, {@code inStream} may contain a PKCS#7 certificate
 * chain. This is a PKCS#7 <i>SignedData</i> object, with the only
 * significant field being <i>certificates</i>. In particular, the
 * signature and the contents are ignored. This format allows multiple
 * certificates to be downloaded at once. If no certificates are present,
 * an empty collection is returned.
 *
 * <p>Note that if the given input stream does not support
 * {@link java.io.InputStream#mark(int) mark} and
 * {@link java.io.InputStream#reset() reset}, this method will
 * consume the entire input stream.
 *
 * @param inStream the input stream with the certificates.
 *
 * @return a (possibly empty) collection view of
 * java.security.cert.Certificate objects
 * initialized with the data from the input stream.
 *
 * @exception CertificateException on parsing errors.
