/**
 * Returns a bounding {@link Rectangle} that completely encloses

 * The Area class will attempt to return the tightest bounding
 * box possible for the Shape.  The bounding box will not be
 * padded to include the control points of curves in the outline
 * of the Shape, but should tightly fit the actual geometry of
 * the outline itself.  Since the returned object represents
 * the bounding box with integers, the bounding box can only be
 * as tight as the nearest integer coordinates that encompass
 * the geometry of the Shape.
 * @return    the bounding <code>Rectangle</code> for the
 * <code>Area</code>.
