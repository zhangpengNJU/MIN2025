// When a modal dialog is hidden its modal filter may not be deleted from
// EventDispatchThread event filters immediately, so we need to mark the filter
// as disabled to prevent it from working. Simple checking for visibility of
// the modalDialog is not enough, as it can be hidden and then shown again
// with a new event pump and a new filter
