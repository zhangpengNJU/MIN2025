 * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.

 * The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
 * {@link TemporalAmount#subtractFrom(Temporal)}. The amount implementation is free
 * to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
 * calls back to {@link #minus(long, TemporalUnit)}. Consult the documentation
 * of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.

 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

 * @param amountToSubtract  the amount to subtract, not null
