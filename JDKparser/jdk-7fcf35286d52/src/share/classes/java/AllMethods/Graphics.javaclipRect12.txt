/**
 * Intersects the current clip with the specified rectangle.
 * The resulting clipping area is the intersection of the current
 * clipping area and the specified rectangle.  If there is no
 * current clipping area, either because the clip has never been
 * set, or the clip has been cleared using <code>setClip(null)</code>,
 * the specified rectangle becomes the new clip.
 * This method sets the user clip, which is independent of the
 * clipping associated with device bounds and window visibility.
 * This method can only be used to make the current clip smaller.
 * To set the current clip larger, use any of the setClip methods.
 * Rendering operations have no effect outside of the clipping area.
 * @param x the x coordinate of the rectangle to intersect the clip with
 * @param y the y coordinate of the rectangle to intersect the clip with
 * @param width the width of the rectangle to intersect the clip with
 * @param height the height of the rectangle to intersect the clip with
 * @see #setClip(int, int, int, int)
 * @see #setClip(Shape)
