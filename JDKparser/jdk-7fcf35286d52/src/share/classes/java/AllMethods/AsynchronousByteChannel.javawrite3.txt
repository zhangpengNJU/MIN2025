/**
 * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.
 *
 * <p> This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
 * sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The method
 * behaves in exactly the same manner as the {@link
 * #write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)
 * write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)} method except that instead
 * of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a {@code Future}
 * representing the pending result. The {@code Future}'s {@link Future#get()
 * get} method returns the number of bytes written.
 *
 * @param   src
 *          The buffer from which bytes are to be retrieved
 *
 * @return A Future representing the result of the operation
 *
 * @throws  WritePendingException
 *          If the channel does not allow more than one write to be outstanding
 *          and a previous write has not completed
