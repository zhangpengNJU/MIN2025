/**
 * Returns an array of all {@code Frame}s created by this application.

 * <b>Warning:</b> this method may return system created frames, such
 * as a shared, hidden frame which is used by Swing. Applications
 * should not assume the existence of these frames, nor should an
 * application assume anything about these frames such as component
 * positions, <code>LayoutManager</code>s or serialization.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>: To obtain a list of all ownerless windows, including
 * ownerless {@code Dialog}s (introduced in release 1.6), use {@link
 * Window#getOwnerlessWindows Window.getOwnerlessWindows}.
