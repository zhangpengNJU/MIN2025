/**
 * Reports whether this driver is a genuine JDBC
 * Compliant&trade; driver.
 * A driver may only report <code>true</code> here if it passes the JDBC
 * compliance tests; otherwise it is required to return <code>false</code>.
 * <P>
 * JDBC compliance requires full support for the JDBC API and full support
 * for SQL 92 Entry Level.  It is expected that JDBC compliant drivers will
 * be available for all the major commercial databases.
 * <P>
 * This method is not intended to encourage the development of non-JDBC
 * compliant drivers, but is a recognition of the fact that some vendors
 * are interested in using the JDBC API and framework for lightweight
 * databases that do not support full database functionality, or for
 * special databases such as document information retrieval where a SQL
 * implementation may not be feasible.
 * @return <code>true</code> if this driver is JDBC Compliant; <code>false</code>
 *         otherwise
