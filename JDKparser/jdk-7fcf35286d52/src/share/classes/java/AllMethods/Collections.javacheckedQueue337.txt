/**
 * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified queue.
 * Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in
 * an immediate {@link ClassCastException}.  Assuming a queue contains
 * no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe
 * view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the queue
 * takes place through the view, it is <i>guaranteed</i> that the
 * queue cannot contain an incorrectly typed element.
 *
 * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
 * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection
 * checkedCollection} method.
 *
 * <p>The returned queue will be serializable if the specified queue
 * is serializable.
 *
 * <p>Since {@code null} is considered to be a value of any reference
 * type, the returned queue permits insertion of {@code null} elements
 * whenever the backing queue does.
 *
 * @param <E> the class of the objects in the queue
 * @param queue the queue for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be
 *             returned
 * @param type the type of element that {@code queue} is permitted to hold
 * @return a dynamically typesafe view of the specified queue
 * @since 1.8
