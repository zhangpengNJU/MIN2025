/**
 * Returns a new file attribute view to access the file attributes of a file
 * in this directory.
 *
 * <p> The resulting file attribute view can be used to read or update the
 * attributes of file in this directory. The {@code type} parameter specifies
 * the type of the attribute view and the method returns an instance of that
 * type if supported. Invoking this method to obtain a {@link
 * BasicFileAttributeView} always returns an instance of that class that is
 * bound to the file in the directory.
 *
 * <p> The state of resulting file attribute view is intimately connected
 * to this directory stream. Once the directory stream {@link #close closed},
 * then all methods to read or update attributes will throw {@link
 * ClosedDirectoryStreamException ClosedDirectoryStreamException}. The
 * file is not required to exist at the time that the file attribute view
 * is created but methods to read or update attributes of the file will
 * fail when invoked and the file does not exist.
 *
 * @param   <V>
 *          The {@code FileAttributeView} type
 * @param   path
 *          the path of the file
 * @param   type
 *          the {@code Class} object corresponding to the file attribute view
 * @param   options
 *          options indicating how symbolic links are handled
 *
 * @return  a new file attribute view of the specified type bound to a
 *          this directory stream, or {@code null} if the attribute view
 *          type is not available
