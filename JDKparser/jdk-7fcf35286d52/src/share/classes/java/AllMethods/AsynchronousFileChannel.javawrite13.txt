/**
 * Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer, starting
 * at the given file position.
 *
 * <p> This method works in the same manner as the {@link
 * AsynchronousByteChannel#write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)}
 * method, except that bytes are written starting at the given file position.
 * If the given position is greater than the file's size, at the time that
 * the write is attempted, then the file will be grown to accommodate the new
 * bytes; the values of any bytes between the previous end-of-file and the
 * newly-written bytes are unspecified.
 *
 * @param   <A>
 *          The type of the attachment
 * @param   src
 *          The buffer from which bytes are to be transferred
 * @param   position
 *          The file position at which the transfer is to begin;
 *          must be non-negative
 * @param   attachment
 *          The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be {@code null}
 * @param   handler
 *          The handler for consuming the result
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the position is negative
 * @throws  NonWritableChannelException
 *          If this channel was not opened for writing
