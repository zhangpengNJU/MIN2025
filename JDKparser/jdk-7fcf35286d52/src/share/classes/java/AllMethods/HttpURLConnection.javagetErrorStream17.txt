 * help page with suggestions as to what to do.
 *
 * <p>This method will not cause a connection to be initiated.  If
 * the connection was not connected, or if the server did not have
 * an error while connecting or if the server had an error but
 * no error data was sent, this method will return null. This is
 * the default.
 *
 * @return an error stream if any, null if there have been no
 * errors, the connection is not connected or the server sent no
 * useful data.
