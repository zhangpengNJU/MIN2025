/**

 * a {@code Short} object that represents the
 * {@code short} value specified by the string.
 *
 * <p>In other words, this method returns a {@code Short} object
 * equal to the value of:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *  {@code new Short(Short.parseShort(s))}

 *
 * @param s the string to be parsed
 * @return  a {@code Short} object holding the value
 *          represented by the string argument
 * @throws  NumberFormatException If the {@code String} does
 *          not contain a parsable {@code short}.
