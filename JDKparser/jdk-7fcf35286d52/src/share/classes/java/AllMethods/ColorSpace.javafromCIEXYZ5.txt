/**
 * Transforms a color value assumed to be in the CS_CIEXYZ conversion
 * color space into this ColorSpace.
 * <p>
 * This method transforms color values using relative colorimetry,
 * as defined by the International Color Consortium standard.  This
 * means that the XYZ argument values taken by this method are represented
 * relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space.
 * This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion
 * process in which colors are transformed from an input color
 * space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  The color
 * values returned by this method are not those that would produce
 * the XYZ value passed to the method when measured by a colorimeter.
 * If you have XYZ values corresponding to measurements made using
 * current CIE recommended practices, they must be converted to D50
 * relative values before being passed to this method.
 * See the {@link ICC_ColorSpace#fromCIEXYZ(float[]) fromCIEXYZ} method of
 * <code>ICC_ColorSpace</code> for further information.
 * <p>
 * @param colorvalue a float array with length of at least 3
 * @return a float array with length equal to the number of
 *         components in this ColorSpace
 * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if array length is not
 *         at least 3
