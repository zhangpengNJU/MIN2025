 * Renders a {@link RenderedImage},

 * The transformation from user space into device space is done with
 * the current <code>Transform</code> in the <code>Graphics2D</code>.
 * The specified transformation is applied to the image before the
 * transform attribute in the <code>Graphics2D</code> context is applied.
 * The rendering attributes applied include the <code>Clip</code>,
 * <code>Transform</code>, and <code>Composite</code> attributes. Note
 * that no rendering is done if the specified transform is
 * noninvertible.
 * @param img the image to be rendered. This method does
 *            nothing if <code>img</code> is null.
 * @param xform the transformation from image space into user space
