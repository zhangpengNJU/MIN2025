/**
 * Updates the designated column using the given <code>Reader</code>
 * object, which is the given number of characters long.
 * When a very large UNICODE value is input to a <code>LONGVARCHAR</code>
 * parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a
 * <code>java.io.Reader</code> object. The JDBC driver will
 * do any necessary conversion from UNICODE to the database char format.
 *
 * <p>
 * The updater methods are used to update column values in the
 * current row or the insert row.  The updater methods do not
 * update the underlying database; instead the <code>updateRow</code> or
 * <code>insertRow</code> methods are called to update the database.
 *
 * @param columnLabel the label for the column specified with the SQL AS clause.  If the SQL AS clause was not specified, then the label is the name of the column
 * @param reader An object that contains the data to set the parameter value to.
 * @param length the number of characters in the parameter data.
 * @throws SQLException if the columnLabel is not valid;
 * if the driver does not support national
 *         character sets;  if the driver can detect that a data conversion
 *  error could occur; this method is called on a closed result set;
 *  if a database access error occurs or
 * the result set concurrency is <code>CONCUR_READ_ONLY</code>
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
