/**
 * Solves the cubic whose coefficients are in the <code>eqn</code>
 * array and places the non-complex roots back into the same array,
 * returning the number of roots.  The solved cubic is represented
 * by the equation:
 * <pre>
 *     eqn = {c, b, a, d}
 *     dx^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0
 * </pre>
 * A return value of -1 is used to distinguish a constant equation
 * that might be always 0 or never 0 from an equation that has no
 * zeroes.
 * @param eqn an array containing coefficients for a cubic
 * @return the number of roots, or -1 if the equation is a constant.
 * @since 1.2
