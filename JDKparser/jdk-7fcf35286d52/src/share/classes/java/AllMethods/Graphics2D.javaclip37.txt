/**
 * Intersects the current <code>Clip</code> with the interior of the

 * <code>Transform</code> before being intersected with the current
 * <code>Clip</code>.  This method is used to make the current
 * <code>Clip</code> smaller.
 * To make the <code>Clip</code> larger, use <code>setClip</code>.
 * The <i>user clip</i> modified by this method is independent of the
 * clipping associated with device bounds and visibility.  If no clip has
 * previously been set, or if the clip has been cleared using
 * {@link Graphics#setClip(Shape) setClip} with a <code>null</code>
 * argument, the specified <code>Shape</code> becomes the new
 * user clip.
 * @param s the <code>Shape</code> to be intersected with the current
 *          <code>Clip</code>.  If <code>s</code> is <code>null</code>,
 *          this method clears the current <code>Clip</code>.
