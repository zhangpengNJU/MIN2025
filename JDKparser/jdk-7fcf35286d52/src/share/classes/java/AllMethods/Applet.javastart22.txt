/**
 * Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 * this applet that it should start its execution. It is called after
 * the <code>init</code> method and each time the applet is revisited
 * in a Web page.
 * <p>
 * A subclass of <code>Applet</code> should override this method if
 * it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 * page containing it is visited. For example, an applet with
 * animation might want to use the <code>start</code> method to
 * resume animation, and the <code>stop</code> method to suspend the
 * animation.
 * <p>
 * Note: some methods, such as <code>getLocationOnScreen</code>, can only
 * provide meaningful results if the applet is showing.  Because
 * <code>isShowing</code> returns <code>false</code> when the applet's
 * <code>start</code> is first called, methods requiring
 * <code>isShowing</code> to return <code>true</code> should be called from
 * a <code>ComponentListener</code>.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this method provided by the
 * <code>Applet</code> class does nothing.
