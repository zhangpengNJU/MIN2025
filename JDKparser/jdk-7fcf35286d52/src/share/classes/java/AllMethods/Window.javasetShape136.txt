/**
 * Sets the shape of the window.
 * <p>
 * Setting a shape cuts off some parts of the window. Only the parts that
 * belong to the given {@link Shape} remain visible and clickable. If
 * the shape argument is {@code null}, this method restores the default
 * shape, making the window rectangular on most platforms.
 * <p>
 * The following conditions must be met to set a non-null shape:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@link GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency#PERPIXEL_TRANSPARENT
 * PERPIXEL_TRANSPARENT} translucency must be supported by the
 * underlying system
 * <li>The window must be undecorated (see {@link Frame#setUndecorated}
 * and {@link Dialog#setUndecorated})
 * <li>The window must not be in full-screen mode (see {@link
 * GraphicsDevice#setFullScreenWindow(Window)})
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the requested shape is not {@code null}, and any of the above
 * conditions are not met, the shape of this window will not change,
 * and either the {@code UnsupportedOperationException} or {@code
 * IllegalComponentStateException} will be thrown.
 * <p>
 * The translucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the
 * alpha component of their color (see {@link Window#setBackground(Color)}) and the
 * opacity value (see {@link #setOpacity(float)}). See {@link
 * GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency} for more details.
 *
 * @param shape the shape to set to the window
 *
 * @throws IllegalComponentStateException if the shape is not {@code
 *     null} and the window is decorated
 * @throws IllegalComponentStateException if the shape is not {@code
 *     null} and the window is in full-screen mode
 * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the shape is not {@code
 *     null} and {@link GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency#PERPIXEL_TRANSPARENT
 *     PERPIXEL_TRANSPARENT} translucency is not supported
