/**
 * Translates a string from ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) to Unicode,
 * as defined by the ToUnicode operation of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3490.txt">RFC 3490</a>.
 *
 * <p>ToUnicode never fails. In case of any error, the input string is returned unmodified.
 *
 * <p> A label is an individual part of a domain name. The original ToUnicode operation,
 * as defined in RFC 3490, only operates on a single label. This method can handle
 * both label and entire domain name, by assuming that labels in a domain name are
 * always separated by dots. The following characters are recognized as dots:
 * &#0092;u002E (full stop), &#0092;u3002 (ideographic full stop), &#0092;uFF0E (fullwidth full stop),
 * and &#0092;uFF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop).
 *
 * @param input     the string to be processed
 * @param flag      process flag; can be 0 or any logical OR of possible flags
 *
 * @return          the translated {@code String}
