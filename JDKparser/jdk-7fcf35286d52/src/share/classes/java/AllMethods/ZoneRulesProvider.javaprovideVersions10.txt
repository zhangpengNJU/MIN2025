/**
 * SPI method to get the history of rules for the zone ID.
 * <p>
 * This returns a map of historical rules keyed by a version string.
 * The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
 * The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
 * be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
 * The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
 * followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
 * they do not have to provide a history of rules.
 * Thus the map will contain at least one element, and will only contain
 * more than one element if historical rule information is available.
 * <p>
 * The returned versions remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
 * A dynamic provider may increase the set of versions as more data becomes available.
 *
 * @param zoneId  the zone ID as defined by {@code ZoneId}, not null
 * @return a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
 *  from oldest to newest, not null
 * @throws ZoneRulesException if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID
