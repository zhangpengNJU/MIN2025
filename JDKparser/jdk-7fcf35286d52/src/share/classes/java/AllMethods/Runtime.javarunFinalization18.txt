/**
 * Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.
 * Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend
 * effort toward running the <code>finalize</code> methods of objects
 * that have been found to be discarded but whose <code>finalize</code>
 * methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
 * method call, the virtual machine has made a best effort to
 * complete all outstanding finalizations.
 * <p>
 * The virtual machine performs the finalization process
 * automatically as needed, in a separate thread, if the
 * <code>runFinalization</code> method is not invoked explicitly.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link System#runFinalization()} is the conventional
 * and convenient means of invoking this method.
