/**
 * Gets the latest committed text from the text editing component and
 * removes it from the component's text body.
 * This is used for the "Undo Commit" feature in some input methods, where
 * the committed text reverts to its previous composed state. The composed
 * text will be sent to the component using an InputMethodEvent.
 *
 * <p>
 * Generally, this feature should only be supported immediately after the
 * text was committed, not after the user performed other operations on the
 * text. When the feature is not supported, return null.
 *
 * <p>
 * The input method may provide a list of attributes that it is
 * interested in. In that case, information about other attributes that
 * the implementor may have need not be made accessible through the
 * iterator. If the list is null, all available attribute information
 * should be made accessible.
 *
 * @param attributes a list of attributes that the input method is
 * interested in
 * @return the latest committed text, or null when the "Undo Commit"
 * feature is not supported
