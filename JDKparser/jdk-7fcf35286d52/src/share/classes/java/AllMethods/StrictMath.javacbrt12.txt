/**
 * Returns the cube root of a {@code double} value.  For

 * -cbrt(x)}; that is, the cube root of a negative value is
 * the negative of the cube root of that value's magnitude.
 * Special cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
 *
 * <li>If the argument is infinite, then the result is an infinity
 * with the same sign as the argument.
 *
 * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
 * same sign as the argument.

 *
 * @param   a   a value.
 * @return  the cube root of {@code a}.
