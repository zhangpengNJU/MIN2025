/**
 * Moves the cursor to the insert row.  The current cursor position is
 * remembered while the cursor is positioned on the insert row.
 *
 * The insert row is a special row associated with an updatable
 * result set.  It is essentially a buffer where a new row may
 * be constructed by calling the updater methods prior to
 * inserting the row into the result set.
 *
 * Only the updater, getter,
 * and <code>insertRow</code> methods may be
 * called when the cursor is on the insert row.  All of the columns in
 * a result set must be given a value each time this method is
 * called before calling <code>insertRow</code>.
 * An updater method must be called before a
 * getter method can be called on a column value.
 *
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs; this
 * method is called on a closed result set
 * or the result set concurrency is <code>CONCUR_READ_ONLY</code>
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
 * @since 1.2
