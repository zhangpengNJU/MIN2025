 * defined to be an <i>opening parenthesis</i>.  This will appear
 * as a "(" in text that is left-to-right but as a ")" in text
 * that is right-to-left.
 *
 * @param   codePoint the character (Unicode code point) to be tested.
 * @return  {@code true} if the character is mirrored, {@code false}
 *          if the character is not mirrored or is not defined.
