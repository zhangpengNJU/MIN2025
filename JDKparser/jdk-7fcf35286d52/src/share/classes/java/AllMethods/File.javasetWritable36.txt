/**
 * Sets the owner's or everybody's write permission for this abstract
 * pathname. On some platforms it may be possible to start the Java virtual
 * machine with special privileges that allow it to modify files that
 * disallow write operations.
 *
 * <p> The {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines methods that operate on
 * file attributes including file permissions. This may be used when finer
 * manipulation of file permissions is required.
 *
 * @param   writable
 *          If <code>true</code>, sets the access permission to allow write
 *          operations; if <code>false</code> to disallow write operations
 *
 * @param   ownerOnly
 *          If <code>true</code>, the write permission applies only to the
 *          owner's write permission; otherwise, it applies to everybody.  If
 *          the underlying file system can not distinguish the owner's write
 *          permission from that of others, then the permission will apply to
 *          everybody, regardless of this value.
 *
 * @return  <code>true</code> if and only if the operation succeeded. The
 *          operation will fail if the user does not have permission to change
 *          the access permissions of this abstract pathname.
 *
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager exists and its <code>{@link
 *          java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}</code>
 *          method denies write access to the named file
 *
 * @since 1.6
