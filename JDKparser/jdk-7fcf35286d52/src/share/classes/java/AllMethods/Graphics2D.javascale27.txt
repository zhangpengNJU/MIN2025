/**
 * Concatenates the current <code>Graphics2D</code>
 * <code>Transform</code> with a scaling transformation
 * Subsequent rendering is resized according to the specified scaling
 * factors relative to the previous scaling.
 * This is equivalent to calling <code>transform(S)</code>, where S is an
 * <code>AffineTransform</code> represented by the following matrix:
 * <pre>
 *          [   sx   0    0   ]
 *          [   0    sy   0   ]
 *          [   0    0    1   ]
 * </pre>
 * @param sx the amount by which X coordinates in subsequent
 * rendering operations are multiplied relative to previous
 * rendering operations.
 * @param sy the amount by which Y coordinates in subsequent
 * rendering operations are multiplied relative to previous
 * rendering operations.
