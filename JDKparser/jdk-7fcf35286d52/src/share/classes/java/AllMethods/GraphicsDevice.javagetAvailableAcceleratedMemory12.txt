/**
 * This method returns the number of bytes available in
 * accelerated memory on this device.
 * Some images are created or cached
 * in accelerated memory on a first-come,
 * first-served basis.  On some operating systems,
 * this memory is a finite resource.  Calling this method
 * and scheduling the creation and flushing of images carefully may
 * enable applications to make the most efficient use of
 * that finite resource.
 * <br>
 * Note that the number returned is a snapshot of how much
 * memory is available; some images may still have problems
 * being allocated into that memory.  For example, depending
 * on operating system, driver, memory configuration, and
 * thread situations, the full extent of the size reported
 * may not be available for a given image.  There are further
 * inquiry methods on the {@link ImageCapabilities} object
 * associated with a VolatileImage that can be used to determine
 * whether a particular VolatileImage has been created in accelerated
 * memory.
 * @return number of bytes available in accelerated memory.
 * A negative return value indicates that the amount of accelerated memory
 * on this GraphicsDevice is indeterminate.
 * @see java.awt.image.VolatileImage#flush
 * @see ImageCapabilities#isAccelerated
