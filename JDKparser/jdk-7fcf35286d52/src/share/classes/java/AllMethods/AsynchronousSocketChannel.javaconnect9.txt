/**
 * Connects this channel.
 *
 * <p> This method initiates an operation to connect this channel. This
 * method behaves in exactly the same manner as the {@link
 * #connect(SocketAddress, Object, CompletionHandler)} method except that
 * instead of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a {@code
 * Future} representing the pending result. The {@code Future}'s {@link
 * Future#get() get} method returns {@code null} on successful completion.
 *
 * @param   remote
 *          The remote address to which this channel is to be connected
 *
 * @return  A {@code Future} object representing the pending result
 *
 * @throws  UnresolvedAddressException
 *          If the given remote address is not fully resolved
 * @throws  UnsupportedAddressTypeException
 *          If the type of the given remote address is not supported
 * @throws  AlreadyConnectedException
 *          If this channel is already connected
 * @throws  ConnectionPendingException
 *          If a connection operation is already in progress on this channel
 * @throws  SecurityException
 *          If a security manager has been installed
 *          and it does not permit access to the given remote endpoint
