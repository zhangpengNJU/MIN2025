 * of its pathname string and the decimal value
 * <code>1234321</code>.  On Microsoft Windows systems, the hash
 * code is equal to the exclusive <em>or</em> of the hash code of
 * its pathname string converted to lower case and the decimal
 * value <code>1234321</code>.  Locale is not taken into account on
