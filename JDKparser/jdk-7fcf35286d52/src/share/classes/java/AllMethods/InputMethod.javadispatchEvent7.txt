/**
 * Dispatches the event to the input method. If input method support is
 * enabled for the focussed component, incoming events of certain types
 * are dispatched to the current input method for this component before
 * they are dispatched to the component's methods or event listeners.
 * The input method decides whether it needs to handle the event. If it
 * does, it also calls the event's <code>consume</code> method; this
 * causes the event to not get dispatched to the component's event
 * processing methods or event listeners.
 * <p>
 * Events are dispatched if they are instances of InputEvent or its
 * subclasses.
 * This includes instances of the AWT classes KeyEvent and MouseEvent.
 * <p>
 * This method is called by {@link java.awt.im.InputContext#dispatchEvent InputContext.dispatchEvent}.
 *
 * @param event the event being dispatched to the input method
 * @exception NullPointerException if <code>event</code> is null
