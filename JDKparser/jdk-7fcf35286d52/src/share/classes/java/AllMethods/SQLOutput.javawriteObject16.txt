// ================================================================
// Methods for writing items of SQL user-defined types to the stream.
// These methods pass objects to the database as values of SQL
// Structured Types, Distinct Types, Constructed Types, and Locator
// Types.  They decompose the Java object(s) and write leaf data
// items using the methods above.

/**
 * Writes to the stream the data contained in the given
 * <code>SQLData</code> object.
 * When the <code>SQLData</code> object is <code>null</code>, this
 * method writes an SQL <code>NULL</code> to the stream.
 * Otherwise, it calls the <code>SQLData.writeSQL</code>
 * method of the given object, which
 * writes the object's attributes to the stream.
 * The implementation of the method <code>SQLData.writeSQL</code>
 * calls the appropriate <code>SQLOutput</code> writer method(s)
 * for writing each of the object's attributes in order.
 * The attributes must be read from an <code>SQLInput</code>
 * input stream and written to an <code>SQLOutput</code>
 * output stream in the same order in which they were
 * listed in the SQL definition of the user-defined type.
 *
 * @param x the object representing data of an SQL structured or
 * distinct type
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
 * @since 1.2
