/**
 * Justify this layout.  Overridden by subclassers to control justification
 * (if there were subclassers, that is...)
 *
 * The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes (from the
 * source text, possibly defaulted by the layout attributes) indicate a
 * non-zero justification ratio.  The text will be justified to the
 * indicated width.  The current implementation also adjusts hanging
 * punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width.
 * Once justified, the layout may not be rejustified.
 * <p>
 * Some code may rely on immutablity of layouts.  Subclassers should not
 * call this directly, but instead should call getJustifiedLayout, which
 * will call this method on a clone of this layout, preserving
 * the original.
 *
 * @param justificationWidth the width to use when justifying the line.
 * For best results, it should not be too different from the current
 * advance of the line.
 * @see #getJustifiedLayout(float)
