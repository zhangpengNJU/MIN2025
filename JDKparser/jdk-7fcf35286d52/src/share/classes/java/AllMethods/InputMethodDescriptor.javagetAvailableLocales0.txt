/**
 * Returns the locales supported by the corresponding input method.
 * The locale may describe just the language, or may also include
 * country and variant information if needed.
 * The information is used to select input methods by locale
 * ({@link java.awt.im.InputContext#selectInputMethod(Locale)}). It may also
 * be used to sort input methods by locale in a user-visible
 * list of input methods.
 * <p>
 * Only the input method's primary locales should be returned.
 * For example, if a Japanese input method also has a pass-through
 * mode for Roman characters, typically still only Japanese would
 * be returned. Thus, the list of locales returned is typically
 * a subset of the locales for which the corresponding input method's
 * implementation of {@link java.awt.im.spi.InputMethod#setLocale} returns true.
 * <p>
 * If {@link #hasDynamicLocaleList} returns true, this method is
 * called each time the information is needed. This
 * gives input methods that depend on network resources the chance
 * to add or remove locales as resources become available or
 * unavailable.
 *
 * @return the locales supported by the input method
 * @exception AWTException if it can be determined that the input method
 * is inoperable, for example, because of incomplete installation.
