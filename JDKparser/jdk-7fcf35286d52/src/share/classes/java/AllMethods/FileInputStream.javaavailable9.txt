/**
 * Returns an estimate of the number of remaining bytes that can be read (or
 * skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next
 * invocation of a method for this input stream. Returns 0 when the file
 * position is beyond EOF. The next invocation might be the same thread
 * or another thread. A single read or skip of this many bytes will not
 * block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
 *
 * <p> In some cases, a non-blocking read (or skip) may appear to be
 * blocked when it is merely slow, for example when reading large
 * files over slow networks.
 *
 * @return     an estimate of the number of remaining bytes that can be read
 *             (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking.
 * @exception  IOException  if this file input stream has been closed by calling
 *             {@code close} or an I/O error occurs.
