/**
 * Returns the floating-point number adjacent to the first
 * argument in the direction of the second argument.  If both
 * arguments compare as equal the second argument is returned.
 *
 * <p>
 * Special cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li> If either argument is a NaN, then NaN is returned.
 *
 * <li> If both arguments are signed zeros, {@code direction}
 * is returned unchanged (as implied by the requirement of
 * returning the second argument if the arguments compare as
 * equal).
 *
 * <li> If {@code start} is
 * &plusmn;{@link Double#MIN_VALUE} and {@code direction}
 * has a value such that the result should have a smaller
 * magnitude, then a zero with the same sign as {@code start}
 * is returned.
 *
 * <li> If {@code start} is infinite and
 * {@code direction} has a value such that the result should
 * have a smaller magnitude, {@link Double#MAX_VALUE} with the
 * same sign as {@code start} is returned.
 *
 * <li> If {@code start} is equal to &plusmn;
 * {@link Double#MAX_VALUE} and {@code direction} has a
 * value such that the result should have a larger magnitude, an
 * infinity with same sign as {@code start} is returned.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param start  starting floating-point value
