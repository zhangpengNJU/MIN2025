 * Gets the duration of this unit, which may be an estimate.

 * All units return a duration measured in standard nanoseconds from this method.
 * The duration will be positive and non-zero.
 * For example, an hour has a duration of {@code 60 * 60 * 1,000,000,000ns}.
 * <p>
 * Some units may return an accurate duration while others return an estimate.
 * For example, days have an estimated duration due to the possibility of
 * daylight saving time changes.
 * To determine if the duration is an estimate, use {@link #isDurationEstimated()}.
