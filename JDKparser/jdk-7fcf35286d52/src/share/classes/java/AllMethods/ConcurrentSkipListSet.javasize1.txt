/**
 * Returns the number of elements in this set.  If this set
 * contains more than {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} elements, it
 * returns {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
 *
 * <p>Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is
 * <em>NOT</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the
 * asynchronous nature of these sets, determining the current
 * number of elements requires traversing them all to count them.
 * Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during
 * execution of this method, in which case the returned result
 * will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very
 * useful in concurrent applications.
