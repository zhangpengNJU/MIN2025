/**
 * Returns the attribute's ASN.1 DER-encoded value as a string.
 * An ASN.1 DER-encoded value is returned in one of the following
 * {@code String} formats:
 * <ul>
 * <li> the DER encoding of a basic ASN.1 type that has a natural
 *      string representation is returned as the string itself.
 *      Such types are currently limited to BOOLEAN, INTEGER,
 *      OBJECT IDENTIFIER, UTCTime, GeneralizedTime and the
 *      following six ASN.1 string types: UTF8String,
 *      PrintableString, T61String, IA5String, BMPString and
 *      GeneralString.
 * <li> the DER encoding of any other ASN.1 type is not decoded but
 *      returned as a binary string of colon-separated pairs of
 *      hexadecimal digits.
 * </ul>
 * Multi-valued attributes are represented as a comma-separated
 * list of values, enclosed in square brackets. See
 * {@link Arrays#toString(java.lang.Object[])}.
 *
 * @return the attribute value's string encoding
