/**
 * Returns whether the specified Container is the focus cycle root of this

 * a single focus cycle root and each Container which is not a focus cycle
 * root belongs to only a single focus traversal cycle. Containers which
 * are focus cycle roots belong to two cycles: one rooted at the Container
 * itself, and one rooted at the Container's nearest focus-cycle-root
 * ancestor. This method will return <code>true</code> for both such
 * Containers in this case.

 * @param container the Container to be tested
 * @return <code>true</code> if the specified Container is a focus-cycle-
 *         root of this Container; <code>false</code> otherwise
