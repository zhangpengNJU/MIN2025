/**
 * Produces the ordered values of the attributes of the SQL
 * structured type that this <code>Struct</code> object represents.
 * As individual attributes are processed, this method uses the type map
 * associated with the
 * connection for customizations of the type mappings.
 * If there is no
 * entry in the connection's type map that matches the structured
 * type that an attribute represents,
 * the driver uses the standard mapping.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, this method calls the method
 * <code>getObject</code> on each attribute
 * of the structured type and returns a Java array containing
 * the result.
 *
 * @return an array containing the ordered attribute values
 * @exception SQLException if a database access error occurs
 * @exception SQLFeatureNotSupportedException if the JDBC driver does not support
 * this method
