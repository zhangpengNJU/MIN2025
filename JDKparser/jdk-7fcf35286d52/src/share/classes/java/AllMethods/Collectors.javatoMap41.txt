/**
 * Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into a
 * {@code Map} whose keys and values are the result of applying the provided
 * mapping functions to the input elements.
 *
 * <p>If the mapped
 * keys contains duplicates (according to {@link Object#equals(Object)}),
 * the value mapping function is applied to each equal element, and the
 * results are merged using the provided merging function.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * There are multiple ways to deal with collisions between multiple elements
 * mapping to the same key.  The other forms of {@code toMap} simply use
 * a merge function that throws unconditionally, but you can easily write
 * more flexible merge policies.  For example, if you have a stream
 * of {@code Person}, and you want to produce a "phone book" mapping name to
 * address, but it is possible that two persons have the same name, you can
 * do as follows to gracefully deals with these collisions, and produce a
 * {@code Map} mapping names to a concatenated list of addresses:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Map<String, String> phoneBook
 *         people.stream().collect(toMap(Person::getName,
 *                                       Person::getAddress,
 *                                       (s, a) -> s + ", " + a));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @implNote
 * The returned {@code Collector} is not concurrent.  For parallel stream
 * pipelines, the {@code combiner} function operates by merging the keys
 * from one map into another, which can be an expensive operation.  If it is
 * not required that results are merged into the {@code Map} in encounter
 * order, using {@link #toConcurrentMap(Function, Function, BinaryOperator)}
 * may offer better parallel performance.
 *

 *                      to {@link Map#merge(Object, Object, BiFunction)}
 * @return a {@code Collector} which collects elements into a {@code Map}
