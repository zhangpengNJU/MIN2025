/**
 * Drop membership.
 *
 * <p> If the membership key represents a membership to receive all datagrams
 * then the membership is dropped and the channel will no longer receive any
 * datagrams sent to the group. If the membership key is source-specific
 * then the channel will no longer receive datagrams sent to the group from
 * that source address.
 *
 * <p> After membership is dropped it may still be possible to receive
 * datagrams sent to the group. This can arise when datagrams are waiting to
 * be received in the socket's receive buffer. After membership is dropped
 * then the channel may {@link MulticastChannel#join join} the group again
 * in which case a new membership key is returned.
 *
 * <p> Upon return, this membership object will be {@link #isValid() invalid}.
 * If the multicast group membership is already invalid then invoking this
 * method has no effect. Once a multicast group membership is invalid,
 * it remains invalid forever.
