/**
 * Resolves parsed {@code ChronoField} values into a date during parsing.
 * <p>
 * Most {@code TemporalField} implementations are resolved using the
 * resolve method on the field. By contrast, the {@code ChronoField} class
 * defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology.
 * As such, {@code ChronoField} date fields are resolved here in the
 * context of a specific chronology.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation, which explains typical resolve behaviour,
 * is provided in {@link AbstractChronology}.
 *
 * @param fieldValues  the map of fields to values, which can be updated, not null
 * @param resolverStyle  the requested type of resolve, not null
 * @return the resolved date, null if insufficient information to create a date
 * @throws DateTimeException if the date cannot be resolved, typically
 *  because of a conflict in the input data
