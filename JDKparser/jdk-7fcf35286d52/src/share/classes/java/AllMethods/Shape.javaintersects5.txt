/**
 * Tests if the interior of the <code>Shape</code> intersects the
 * interior of a specified <code>Rectangle2D</code>.
 * The {@code Shape.intersects()} method allows a {@code Shape}
 * implementation to conservatively return {@code true} when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * there is a high probability that the <code>Rectangle2D</code> and the
 * <code>Shape</code> intersect, but
 * <li>
 * the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
 * are prohibitively expensive.
 * </ul>
 * This means that for some {@code Shapes} this method might
 * return {@code true} even though the {@code Rectangle2D} does not
 * intersect the {@code Shape}.
 * The {@link java.awt.geom.Area Area} class performs
 * more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most
 * {@code Shape} objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
 * answer is required.
 *
 * @param r the specified <code>Rectangle2D</code>
 * @return <code>true</code> if the interior of the <code>Shape</code> and
 *          the interior of the specified <code>Rectangle2D</code>
 *          intersect, or are both highly likely to intersect and intersection
 *          calculations would be too expensive to perform; <code>false</code>
 *          otherwise.
