/**
 * If this Window is visible, brings this Window to the front and may make
 * it the focused Window.
 * <p>
 * Places this Window at the top of the stacking order and shows it in
 * front of any other Windows in this VM. No action will take place if this
 * Window is not visible. Some platforms do not allow Windows which own
 * other Windows to appear on top of those owned Windows. Some platforms
 * may not permit this VM to place its Windows above windows of native
 * applications, or Windows of other VMs. This permission may depend on
 * whether a Window in this VM is already focused. Every attempt will be
 * made to move this Window as high as possible in the stacking order;
 * however, developers should not assume that this method will move this
 * Window above all other windows in every situation.
 * <p>
 * Developers must never assume that this Window is the focused or active
 * Window until this Window receives a WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS or WINDOW_ACTIVATED
 * event. On platforms where the top-most window is the focused window, this
 * method will <b>probably</b> focus this Window (if it is not already focused)
 * under the following conditions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The window meets the requirements outlined in the
 *      {@link #isFocusableWindow} method.
 * <li> The window's property {@code autoRequestFocus} is of the
 *      {@code true} value.
 * <li> Native windowing system allows the window to get focused.
 * </ul>
 * On platforms where the stacking order does not typically affect the focused
 * window, this method will <b>probably</b> leave the focused and active
 * Windows unchanged.
 * <p>
 * If this method causes this Window to be focused, and this Window is a
 * Frame or a Dialog, it will also become activated. If this Window is
 * focused, but it is not a Frame or a Dialog, then the first Frame or
 * Dialog that is an owner of this Window will be activated.
 * <p>
 * If this window is blocked by modal dialog, then the blocking dialog
 * is brought to the front and remains above the blocked window.
