 * stream to which it is emitted, depends on the host environment. The
 * virtual machine may ignore this request if it does not support
 * this feature.
 * <p>
 * Calling this method with argument false suggests that the
 * virtual machine cease emitting per-call debugging information.
 *
 * @param   on   <code>true</code> to enable instruction tracing;
