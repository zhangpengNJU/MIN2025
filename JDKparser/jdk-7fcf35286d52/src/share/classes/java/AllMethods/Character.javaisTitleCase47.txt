/**
 * Determines if the specified character is a titlecase character.
 * <p>
 * A character is a titlecase character if its general
 * category type, provided by {@code Character.getType(ch)},
 * is {@code TITLECASE_LETTER}.
 * <p>
 * Some characters look like pairs of Latin letters. For example, there
 * is an uppercase letter that looks like "LJ" and has a corresponding
 * lowercase letter that looks like "lj". A third form, which looks like "Lj",
 * is the appropriate form to use when rendering a word in lowercase
 * with initial capitals, as for a book title.
 * <p>
 * These are some of the Unicode characters for which this method returns
 * {@code true}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z WITH CARON}
 * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L WITH SMALL LETTER J}
 * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N WITH SMALL LETTER J}
 * <li>{@code LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D WITH SMALL LETTER Z}
 * </ul>
 * <p> Many other Unicode characters are titlecase too.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This method cannot handle <a
 * href="#supplementary"> supplementary characters</a>. To support
 * all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
 * the {@link #isTitleCase(int)} method.
 *
 * @param   ch   the character to be tested.
 * @return  {@code true} if the character is titlecase;
 *          {@code false} otherwise.
 * @see     Character#isLowerCase(char)
 * @see     Character#isUpperCase(char)
