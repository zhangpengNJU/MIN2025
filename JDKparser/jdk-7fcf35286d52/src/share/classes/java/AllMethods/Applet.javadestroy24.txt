/**
 * Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 * this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy
 * any resources that it has allocated. The <code>stop</code> method
 * will always be called before <code>destroy</code>.
 * <p>
 * A subclass of <code>Applet</code> should override this method if
 * it has any operation that it wants to perform before it is
 * destroyed. For example, an applet with threads would use the
 * <code>init</code> method to create the threads and the
 * <code>destroy</code> method to kill them.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this method provided by the
 * <code>Applet</code> class does nothing.
