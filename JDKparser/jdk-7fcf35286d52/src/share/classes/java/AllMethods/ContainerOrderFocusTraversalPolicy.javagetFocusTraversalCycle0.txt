/*
     * We suppose to use getFocusTraversalCycle & getComponentIndex methods in order
     * to divide the policy into two parts:
     * 1) Making the focus traversal cycle.
     * 2) Traversing the cycle.
     * The 1st point assumes producing a list of components representing the focus
     * traversal cycle. The two methods mentioned above should implement this logic.
     * The 2nd point assumes implementing the common concepts of operating on the
     * cycle: traversing back and forth, retrieving the initial/default/first/last
     * component. These concepts are described in the AWT Focus Spec and they are
     * applied to the FocusTraversalPolicy in general.
     * Thus, a descendant of this policy may wish to not reimplement the logic of
     * the 2nd point but just override the implementation of the 1st one.
     * A striking example of such a descendant is the javax.swing.SortingFocusTraversalPolicy.
