/**
 * Test whether that address is reachable. Best effort is made by the
 * implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server
 * configuration may block requests resulting in a unreachable status
 * while some specific ports may be accessible.
 * A typical implementation will use ICMP ECHO REQUESTs if the
 * privilege can be obtained, otherwise it will try to establish
 * a TCP connection on port 7 (Echo) of the destination host.
 * <p>
 * The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time
 * the try should take. If the operation times out before getting an
 * answer, the host is deemed unreachable. A negative value will result
 * in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.
 *
 * @param   timeout the time, in milliseconds, before the call aborts
 * @return a {@code boolean} indicating if the address is reachable.
 * @throws IOException if a network error occurs
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException if {@code timeout} is negative.
