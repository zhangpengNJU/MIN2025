/**
 * Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of

 * units) returned is the largest value <i>k</i> such that:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * this.charAt(<i>k</i>) == ch
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * is true. For other values of {@code ch}, it is the
 * largest value <i>k</i> such that:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * this.codePointAt(<i>k</i>) == ch
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * is true.  In either case, if no such character occurs in this
 * string, then {@code -1} is returned.  The
 * {@code String} is searched backwards starting at the last
 * character.
 *
 * @param   ch   a character (Unicode code point).
 * @return  the index of the last occurrence of the character in the
 *          character sequence represented by this object, or
