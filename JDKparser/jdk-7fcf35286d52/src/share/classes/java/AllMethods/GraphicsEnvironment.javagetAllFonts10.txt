/**
 * Returns an array containing a one-point size instance of all fonts
 * available in this <code>GraphicsEnvironment</code>.  Typical usage
 * would be to allow a user to select a particular font.  Then, the
 * application can size the font and set various font attributes by
 * calling the <code>deriveFont</code> method on the chosen instance.
 * <p>
 * This method provides for the application the most precise control
 * over which <code>Font</code> instance is used to render text.
 * If a font in this <code>GraphicsEnvironment</code> has multiple
 * programmable variations, only one
 * instance of that <code>Font</code> is returned in the array, and
 * other variations must be derived by the application.
 * <p>
 * If a font in this environment has multiple programmable variations,
 * such as Multiple-Master fonts, only one instance of that font is
 * returned in the <code>Font</code> array.  The other variations
 * must be derived by the application.
 *
 * @return an array of <code>Font</code> objects
