/**
 * Returns the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary

 * specified number of bits.  (Bits shifted out of the right hand, or
 * low-order, side reenter on the left, or high-order.)
 *
 * <p>Note that right rotation with a negative distance is equivalent to
 * left rotation: {@code rotateRight(val, -distance) == rotateLeft(val,
 * distance)}.  Note also that rotation by any multiple of 64 is a
 * no-op, so all but the last six bits of the rotation distance can be
 * ignored, even if the distance is negative: {@code rotateRight(val,
 * distance) == rotateRight(val, distance & 0x3F)}.
 *
 * @param i the value whose bits are to be rotated right
 * @param distance the number of bit positions to rotate right
 * @return the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary
 *     representation of the specified {@code long} value right by the
 *     specified number of bits.
