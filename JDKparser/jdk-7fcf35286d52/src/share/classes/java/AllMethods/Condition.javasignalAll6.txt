/**
 * Wakes up all waiting threads.
 *
 * <p>If any threads are waiting on this condition then they are
 * all woken up. Each thread must re-acquire the lock before it can
 * return from {@code await}.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
 *
 * <p>An implementation may (and typically does) require that the
 * current thread hold the lock associated with this {@code
 * Condition} when this method is called. Implementations must
 * document this precondition and any actions taken if the lock is
 * not held. Typically, an exception such as {@link
 * IllegalMonitorStateException} will be thrown.
