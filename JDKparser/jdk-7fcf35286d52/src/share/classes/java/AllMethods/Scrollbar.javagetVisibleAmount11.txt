/**
 * Gets the visible amount of this scroll bar.
 * <p>
 * When a scroll bar is used to select a range of values,
 * the visible amount is used to represent the range of values
 * that are currently visible.  The size of the scroll bar's
 * bubble (also called a thumb or scroll box), usually gives a
 * visual representation of the relationship of the visible
 * amount to the range of the scroll bar.
 * Note that depending on platform, the value of the visible amount property
 * may not be visually indicated by the size of the bubble.
 * <p>
 * The scroll bar's bubble may not be displayed when it is not
 * moveable (e.g. when it takes up the entire length of the
 * scroll bar's track, or when the scroll bar is disabled).
 * Whether the bubble is displayed or not will not affect
 * the value returned by <code>getVisibleAmount</code>.
 *
 * @return      the visible amount of this scroll bar
 * @see         java.awt.Scrollbar#setVisibleAmount
 * @since       JDK1.1
