/**
 * Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization.
 * <p>
 * Calling this method suggests that the Java Virtual Machine expend
 * effort toward running the <code>finalize</code> methods of objects
 * that have been found to be discarded but whose <code>finalize</code>
 * methods have not yet been run. When control returns from the
 * method call, the Java Virtual Machine has made a best effort to
 * complete all outstanding finalizations.
 * <p>
 * The call <code>System.runFinalization()</code> is effectively
 * equivalent to the call:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * Runtime.getRuntime().runFinalization()
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * @see     java.lang.Runtime#runFinalization()
