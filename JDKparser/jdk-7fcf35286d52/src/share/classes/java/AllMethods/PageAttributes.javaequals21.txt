/**
 * Determines whether two PageAttributes are equal to each other.

 * an aliased media is equal to its underlying unique media. Printer
 * resolutions are equal if and only if the feed resolution, cross feed
 * resolution, and units are equal.
 *
 * @param   obj the object whose equality will be checked.
 * @return  whether obj is equal to this PageAttribute according to the
 *          above criteria.
