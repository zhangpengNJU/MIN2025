 * Obtains a clock that returns the current instant ticking in whole seconds
 * using best available system clock.
 * <p>
 * This clock will always have the nano-of-second field set to zero.
 * This ensures that the visible time ticks in whole seconds.
 * The underlying clock is the best available system clock, equivalent to
 * using {@link #system(ZoneId)}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations may use a caching strategy for performance reasons.
 * As such, it is possible that the start of the second observed via this
 * clock will be later than that observed directly via the underlying clock.
 * <p>
 * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
 * It is equivalent to {@code tick(system(zone), Duration.ofSeconds(1))}.
 *
 * @param zone  the time-zone to use to convert the instant to date-time, not null
 * @return a clock that ticks in whole seconds using the specified zone, not null
