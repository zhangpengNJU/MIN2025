/**
 * Creates a localized version of an output stream. This method
 * takes an <code>OutputStream</code> and returns an
 * <code>OutputStream</code> equivalent to the argument in all respects
 * except that it is localized: as Unicode characters are written to
 * the stream, they are automatically converted to the local
 * character set.
 * <p>
 * If the argument is already a localized stream, it may be returned
 * as the result.
 *
 * @deprecated As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to translate a
 * Unicode character stream into a byte stream in the local encoding is via
 * the <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>, <code>BufferedWriter</code>, and
 * <code>PrintWriter</code> classes.
 *
 * @param      out OutputStream to localize
 * @return     a localized output stream
 * @see        java.io.OutputStream
