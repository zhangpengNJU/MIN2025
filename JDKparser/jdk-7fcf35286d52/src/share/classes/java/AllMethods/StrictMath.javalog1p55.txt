/**
 * Returns the natural logarithm of the sum of the argument and 1.
 * Note that for small values {@code x}, the result of
 * {@code log1p(x)} is much closer to the true result of ln(1
 * + {@code x}) than the floating-point evaluation of
 * {@code log(1.0+x)}.
 *
 * <p>Special cases:
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>If the argument is NaN or less than -1, then the result is
 * NaN.
 *
 * <li>If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is
 * positive infinity.
 *
 * <li>If the argument is negative one, then the result is
 * negative infinity.
 *
 * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
 * same sign as the argument.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param   x   a value
 * @return the value ln({@code x}&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), the natural
 * log of {@code x}&nbsp;+&nbsp;1
