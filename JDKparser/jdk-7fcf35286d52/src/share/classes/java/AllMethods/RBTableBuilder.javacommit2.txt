/**
 * Look up for unmapped values in the expanded character table.
 *
 * When the expanding character tables are built by addExpandOrder,
 * it doesn't know what the final ordering of each character
 * in the expansion will be.  Instead, it just puts the raw character
 * code into the table, adding CHARINDEX as a flag.  Now that we've
 * finished building the mapping table, we can go back and look up
 * that character to see what its real collation order is and
 * stick that into the expansion table.  That lets us avoid doing
 * a two-stage lookup later.
