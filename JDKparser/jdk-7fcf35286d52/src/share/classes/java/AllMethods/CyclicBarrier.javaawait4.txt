 * one of the following things happens:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The last thread arrives; or
 * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
 * the current thread; or
 * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
 * one of the other waiting threads; or
 * <li>Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or
 * <li>Some other thread invokes {@link #reset} on this barrier.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If the current thread:
 * <ul>
 * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
 * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
 * </ul>
 * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
 * interrupted status is cleared.
 *
 * <p>If the barrier is {@link #reset} while any thread is waiting,
 * or if the barrier {@linkplain #isBroken is broken} when
 * {@code await} is invoked, or while any thread is waiting, then
 * {@link BrokenBarrierException} is thrown.
 *
 * <p>If any thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting,
 * then all other waiting threads will throw
 * {@link BrokenBarrierException} and the barrier is placed in the broken
 * state.
 *
 * <p>If the current thread is the last thread to arrive, and a
 * non-null barrier action was supplied in the constructor, then the
 * current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to
 * continue.
 * If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception
 * will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in
 * the broken state.
