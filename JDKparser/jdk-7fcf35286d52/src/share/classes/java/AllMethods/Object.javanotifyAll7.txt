/**
 * Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor. A
 * thread waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the
 * {@code wait} methods.
 * <p>
 * The awakened threads will not be able to proceed until the current
 * thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened threads
 * will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might
 * be actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example,
 * the awakened threads enjoy no reliable privilege or disadvantage in
 * being the next thread to lock this object.
 * <p>
 * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
 * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
 * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
 * a monitor.
 *
 * @throws  IllegalMonitorStateException  if the current thread is not
 *               the owner of this object's monitor.
 * @see        java.lang.Object#notify()
 * @see        java.lang.Object#wait()
