/**
 * Gets the {@code issuerUniqueID} value from the certificate.
 * The issuer unique identifier is present in the certificate
 * to handle the possibility of reuse of issuer names over time.
 * RFC 5280 recommends that names not be reused and that
 * conforming certificates not make use of unique identifiers.
 * Applications conforming to that profile should be capable of
 * parsing unique identifiers and making comparisons.
 *
 * <p>The ASN.1 definition for this is:
 * <pre>
 * issuerUniqueID  [1]  IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL
 *
 * UniqueIdentifier  ::=  BIT STRING
 * </pre>
 *
 * @return the issuer unique identifier or null if it is not
 * present in the certificate.
