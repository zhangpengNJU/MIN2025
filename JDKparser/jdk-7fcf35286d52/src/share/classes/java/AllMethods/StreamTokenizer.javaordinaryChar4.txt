 * Specifies that the character argument is "ordinary"

 * character has as a comment character, word component, string
 * delimiter, white space, or number character. When such a character
 * is encountered by the parser, the parser treats it as a
 * single-character token and sets {@code ttype} field to the
 * character value.
 *
 * <p>Making a line terminator character "ordinary" may interfere
 * with the ability of a {@code StreamTokenizer} to count
 * lines. The {@code lineno} method may no longer reflect
 * the presence of such terminator characters in its line count.
