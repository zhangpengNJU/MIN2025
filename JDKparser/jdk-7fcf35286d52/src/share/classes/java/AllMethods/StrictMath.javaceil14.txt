/**
 * Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity)

 * <ul><li>If the argument value is already equal to a
 * mathematical integer, then the result is the same as the
 * argument.  <li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity or
 * positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as
 * the argument.  <li>If the argument value is less than zero but
 * greater than -1.0, then the result is negative zero.</ul> Note
 * that the value of {@code StrictMath.ceil(x)} is exactly the
 * value of {@code -StrictMath.floor(-x)}.
