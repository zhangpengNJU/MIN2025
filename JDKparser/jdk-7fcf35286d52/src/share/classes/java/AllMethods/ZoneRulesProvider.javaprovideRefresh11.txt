 * This could be used to load new rules without stopping the JVM.
 * Dynamic behavior is entirely optional and most providers do not support it.
 * <p>
 * This implementation returns false.
 *
 * @return true if the rules were updated
 * @throws ZoneRulesException if an error occurs during the refresh
