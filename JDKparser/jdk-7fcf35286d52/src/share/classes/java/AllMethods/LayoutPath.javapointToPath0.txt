/**
 * Convert a point in user space to a location relative to the
 * path. The location is chosen so as to minimize the distance
 * from the point to the path (e.g., the magnitude of the offset
 * will be smallest).  If there is more than one such location,
 * the location with the smallest advance is chosen.
 * @param point the point to convert.  If it is not the same
 * object as location, point will remain unmodified by this call.
 * @param location a <code>Point2D</code> to hold the returned location.
 * It can be the same object as point.
 * @return true if the point is associated with the portion of the
 * path preceding the location, false if it is associated with
 * the portion following.  The default, if the location is not at
 * a break or sharp bend in the path, is to return true.
 * @throws NullPointerException if point or location is null
 * @since 1.6
