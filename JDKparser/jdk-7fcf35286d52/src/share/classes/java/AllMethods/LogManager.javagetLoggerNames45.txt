/**
 * Get an enumeration of known logger names.
 * <p>
 * Note:  Loggers may be added dynamically as new classes are loaded.
 * This method only reports on the loggers that are currently registered.
 * It is also important to note that this method only returns the name
 * of a Logger, not a strong reference to the Logger itself.
 * The returned String does nothing to prevent the Logger from being
 * garbage collected. In particular, if the returned name is passed
 * to {@code LogManager.getLogger()}, then the caller must check the
 * return value from {@code LogManager.getLogger()} for null to properly
 * handle the case where the Logger has been garbage collected in the
 * time since its name was returned by this method.
 * <p>
 * @return  enumeration of logger name strings
