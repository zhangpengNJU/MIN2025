/**
 * Returns the long value represented by the string associated with the
 * specified key in this preference node.  The string is converted to
 * a long as by {@link Long#parseLong(String)}.  Returns the
 * specified default if there is no value associated with the key,
 * the backing store is inaccessible, or if
 * <tt>Long.parseLong(String)</tt> would throw a {@link
 * NumberFormatException} if the associated value were passed.  This
 * method is intended for use in conjunction with {@link #putLong}.
 *
 * <p>If the implementation supports <i>stored defaults</i> and such a
 * default exists, is accessible, and could be converted to a long
 * with <tt>Long.parseLong</tt>, this long is returned in preference to
 * the specified default.
 *
 * @param key key whose associated value is to be returned as a long.
 * @param def the value to be returned in the event that this
 *        preference node has no value associated with <tt>key</tt>
 *        or the associated value cannot be interpreted as a long,
 *        or the backing store is inaccessible.
 * @return the long value represented by the string associated with
 *         <tt>key</tt> in this preference node, or <tt>def</tt> if the
 *         associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
 *         a long.
 * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
