 * Method to find a named logger.

 * find Loggers for security sensitive logging.
 * It is also important to note that the Logger associated with the
 * String {@code name} may be garbage collected at any time if there
 * is no strong reference to the Logger. The caller of this method
 * must check the return value for null in order to properly handle
 * the case where the Logger has been garbage collected.

 * @param name name of the logger
 * @return  matching logger or null if none is found
