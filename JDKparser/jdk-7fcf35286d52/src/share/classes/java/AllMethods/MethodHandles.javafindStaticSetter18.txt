 * Produces a method handle giving write access to a static field.

 * Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
 * <p>
 * If the returned method handle is invoked, the field's class will
 * be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.
 * @param refc the class or interface from which the method is accessed
 * @param name the field's name
 * @param type the field's type
 * @return a method handle which can store values into the field
 * @throws NoSuchFieldException if the field does not exist
 * @throws IllegalAccessException if access checking fails, or if the field is not {@code static}
