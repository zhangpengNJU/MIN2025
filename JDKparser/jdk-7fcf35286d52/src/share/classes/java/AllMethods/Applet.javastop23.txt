/**
 * Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 * this applet that it should stop its execution. It is called when
 * the Web page that contains this applet has been replaced by
 * another page, and also just before the applet is to be destroyed.
 * <p>
 * A subclass of <code>Applet</code> should override this method if
 * it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 * page containing it is no longer visible. For example, an applet
 * with animation might want to use the <code>start</code> method to
 * resume animation, and the <code>stop</code> method to suspend the
 * animation.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this method provided by the
 * <code>Applet</code> class does nothing.
