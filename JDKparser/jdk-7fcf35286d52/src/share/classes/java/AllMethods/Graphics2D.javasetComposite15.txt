/**
 * Sets the <code>Composite</code> for the <code>Graphics2D</code> context.
 * The <code>Composite</code> is used in all drawing methods such as
 * <code>drawImage</code>, <code>drawString</code>, <code>draw</code>,
 * and <code>fill</code>.  It specifies how new pixels are to be combined
 * with the existing pixels on the graphics device during the rendering
 * process.
 * <p>If this <code>Graphics2D</code> context is drawing to a
 * <code>Component</code> on the display screen and the
 * <code>Composite</code> is a custom object rather than an
 * instance of the <code>AlphaComposite</code> class, and if
 * there is a security manager, its <code>checkPermission</code>
 * method is called with an <code>AWTPermission("readDisplayPixels")</code>
 * permission.
 * @throws SecurityException
 *         if a custom <code>Composite</code> object is being
 *         used to render to the screen and a security manager
 *         is set and its <code>checkPermission</code> method
 *         does not allow the operation.
 * @param comp the <code>Composite</code> object to be used for rendering
