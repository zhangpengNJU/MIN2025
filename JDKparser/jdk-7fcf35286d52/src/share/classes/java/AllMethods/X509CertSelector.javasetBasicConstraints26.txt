/**
 * Sets the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than or

 * a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity
 * certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done.
 * <p>
 * This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward
 * (from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been
 * built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater
 * than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.
