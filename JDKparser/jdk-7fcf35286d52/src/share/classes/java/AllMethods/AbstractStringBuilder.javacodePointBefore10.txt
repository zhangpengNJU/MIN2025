 * is in the low-surrogate range, {@code (index - 2)} is not
 * negative, and the {@code char} value at {@code (index -
 * 2)} is in the high-surrogate range, then the
 * supplementary code point value of the surrogate pair is
 * returned. If the {@code char} value at {@code index -
 * 1} is an unpaired low-surrogate or a high-surrogate, the
 * surrogate value is returned.
 *
 * @param     index the index following the code point that should be returned
 * @return    the Unicode code point value before the given index.
