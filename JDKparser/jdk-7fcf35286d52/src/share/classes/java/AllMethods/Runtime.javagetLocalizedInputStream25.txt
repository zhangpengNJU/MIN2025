/**
 * Creates a localized version of an input stream. This method takes
 * an <code>InputStream</code> and returns an <code>InputStream</code>
 * equivalent to the argument in all respects except that it is
 * localized: as characters in the local character set are read from
 * the stream, they are automatically converted from the local
 * character set to Unicode.
 * <p>
 * If the argument is already a localized stream, it may be returned
 * as the result.
 *
 * @param      in InputStream to localize
 * @return     a localized input stream
 * @see        java.io.InputStream
 * @see        java.io.BufferedReader#BufferedReader(java.io.Reader)
 * @see        java.io.InputStreamReader#InputStreamReader(java.io.InputStream)
 * @deprecated As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to translate a byte
 * stream in the local encoding into a character stream in Unicode is via
 * the <code>InputStreamReader</code> and <code>BufferedReader</code>
 * classes.
