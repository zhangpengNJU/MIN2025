/**
 * Returns an ImageCapabilities object which can be

 * out more runtime information on the specific VolatileImage
 * object that they have created.  For example, the user
 * might create a VolatileImage but the system may have
 * no video memory left for creating an image of that
 * size, so although the object is a VolatileImage, it is
 * not as accelerated as other VolatileImage objects on
 * this platform might be.  The user might want that
 * information to find other solutions to their problem.
 * @return an <code>ImageCapabilities</code> object that contains
 *         the capabilities of this <code>VolatileImage</code>.
