/**
 * Adds a name to the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished
 * name in the {@code X509CRL} must match at least one of the specified
 * distinguished names.
 * <p>
 * This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of issuer names
 * which {@code X509CRLs} may contain. The specified name is added to
 * any previous value for the issuerNames criterion. If the specified name
 * is a duplicate, it may be ignored.
 * If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER
 * encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for
 * this structure is as follows.
 * <p>
 * The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain
 * a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1
 * notation for this structure appears in the documentation for
 * {@link #setIssuerNames setIssuerNames(Collection names)}.
 * <p>
 * Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against
 * subsequent modifications.
 *
 * @param name a byte array containing the name in ASN.1 DER encoded form
 * @throws IOException if a parsing error occurs
