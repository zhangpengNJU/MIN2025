 * boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
 * Such a case may occur if some set of segments of the
 * path are retraced in the reverse direction such that the
 * two sets of segments cancel each other out without any
 * interior area between them.
 * To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
 * the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
 * involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
 * rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.
