/**
 * Returns the class of the most recently executing method from
 * a class defined using a non-system class loader. A non-system
 * class loader is defined as being a class loader that is not equal to
 * the system class loader (as returned
 * by {@link ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader}) or one of its ancestors.
 * <p>
 * This method will return
 * <code>null</code> in the following three cases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>All methods on the execution stack are from classes
 *   defined using the system class loader or one of its ancestors.
 *
 *   <li>All methods on the execution stack up to the first
 *   "privileged" caller
 *   (see {@link java.security.AccessController#doPrivileged})
 *   are from classes
 *   defined using the system class loader or one of its ancestors.
 *
 *   <li> A call to <code>checkPermission</code> with
 *   <code>java.security.AllPermission</code> does not
 *   result in a SecurityException.
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * @return  the class  of the most recent occurrence on the stack
 *          of a method from a class defined using a non-system class
 *          loader.
 *
 * @deprecated This type of security checking is not recommended.
 *  It is recommended that the <code>checkPermission</code>
 *  call be used instead.
