 * calls its {@code checkConnect} method
 * with the hostname and {@code -1}
 * as its arguments to see if the calling code is allowed to know
 * the hostname for this IP address, i.e., to connect to the host.
 * If the operation is not allowed, it will return
 * the textual representation of the IP address.
 *
 * @return  the host name for this IP address, or if the operation
 *    is not allowed by the security check, the textual
 *    representation of the IP address.
