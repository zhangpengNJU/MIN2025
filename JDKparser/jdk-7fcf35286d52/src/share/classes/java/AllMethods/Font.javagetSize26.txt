/**
 * Returns the point size of this <code>Font</code>, rounded to
 * an integer.
 * Most users are familiar with the idea of using <i>point size</i> to
 * specify the size of glyphs in a font. This point size defines a
 * measurement between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the
 * following line in a single spaced text document. The point size is
 * based on <i>typographic points</i>, approximately 1/72 of an inch.
 * <p>
 * The Java(tm)2D API adopts the convention that one point is
 * equivalent to one unit in user coordinates.  When using a
 * normalized transform for converting user space coordinates to
 * device space coordinates 72 user
 * space units equal 1 inch in device space.  In this case one point
 * is 1/72 of an inch.
 * @return the point size of this <code>Font</code> in 1/72 of an
 *          inch units.
