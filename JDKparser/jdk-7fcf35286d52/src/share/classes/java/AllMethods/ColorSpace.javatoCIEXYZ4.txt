/**
 * Transforms a color value assumed to be in this ColorSpace
 * into the CS_CIEXYZ conversion color space.
 * <p>
 * This method transforms color values using relative colorimetry,
 * as defined by the International Color Consortium standard.  This
 * means that the XYZ values returned by this method are represented
 * relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space.
 * This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion
 * process in which colors are transformed from an input color
 * space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  This
 * representation is not the same as the XYZ values that would
 * be measured from the given color value by a colorimeter.
 * A further transformation is necessary to compute the XYZ values
 * that would be measured using current CIE recommended practices.
 * See the {@link ICC_ColorSpace#toCIEXYZ(float[]) toCIEXYZ} method of
 * <code>ICC_ColorSpace</code> for further information.
 * <p>
 * @param colorvalue a float array with length of at least the number
 *        of components in this ColorSpace
 * @return a float array of length 3
 * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if array length is not
 *         at least the number of components in this ColorSpace.
