 * Returns a copy of this year-month with the specified amount subtracted.

 * This returns a {@code YearMonth}, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
 * The amount is typically {@link Period} but may be any other type implementing
 * the {@link TemporalAmount} interface.
 * <p>
 * The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
 * {@link TemporalAmount#subtractFrom(Temporal)}. The amount implementation is free
 * to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
 * calls back to {@link #minus(long, TemporalUnit)}. Consult the documentation
 * of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param amountToSubtract  the amount to subtract, not null
 * @return a {@code YearMonth} based on this year-month with the subtraction made, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the subtraction cannot be made
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
