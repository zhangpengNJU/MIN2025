 * This method is called
 * <ul>
 * <li>by {@link java.awt.im.InputContext#dispatchEvent InputContext.dispatchEvent}
 *     when a client component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event,
 * <li>when switching to this input method from a different one using the

 * The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
