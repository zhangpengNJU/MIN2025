/**
 * Creates a {@link Spliterator} over the elements described by this
 * {@code Iterable}.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * The default implementation creates an
 * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">early-binding</a></em>
 * spliterator from the iterable's {@code Iterator}.  The spliterator
 * inherits the <em>fail-fast</em> properties of the iterable's iterator.
 *
 * @implNote
 * The default implementation should usually be overridden.  The
 * spliterator returned by the default implementation has poor splitting
 * capabilities, is unsized, and does not report any spliterator
 * characteristics. Implementing classes can nearly always provide a
 * better implementation.
