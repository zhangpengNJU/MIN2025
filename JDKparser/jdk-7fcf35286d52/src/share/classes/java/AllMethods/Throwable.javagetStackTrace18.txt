/**
 * Provides programmatic access to the stack trace information printed by
 * {@link #printStackTrace()}.  Returns an array of stack trace elements,
 * each representing one stack frame.  The zeroth element of the array
 * (assuming the array's length is non-zero) represents the top of the
 * stack, which is the last method invocation in the sequence.  Typically,
 * this is the point at which this throwable was created and thrown.
 * The last element of the array (assuming the array's length is non-zero)
 * represents the bottom of the stack, which is the first method invocation
 * in the sequence.
 *
 * <p>Some virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
 * or more stack frames from the stack trace.  In the extreme case,
 * a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
 * this throwable is permitted to return a zero-length array from this
 * method.  Generally speaking, the array returned by this method will
 * contain one element for every frame that would be printed by
 * {@code printStackTrace}.  Writes to the returned array do not
 * affect future calls to this method.
 *
 * @return an array of stack trace elements representing the stack trace
 *         pertaining to this throwable.
