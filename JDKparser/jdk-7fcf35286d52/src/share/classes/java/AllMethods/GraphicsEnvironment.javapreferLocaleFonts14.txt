/**
 * Indicates a preference for locale-specific fonts in the mapping of
 * logical fonts to physical fonts. Calling this method indicates that font
 * rendering should primarily use fonts specific to the primary writing
 * system (the one indicated by the default encoding and the initial
 * default locale). For example, if the primary writing system is
 * Japanese, then characters should be rendered using a Japanese font
 * if possible, and other fonts should only be used for characters for
 * which the Japanese font doesn't have glyphs.
 * <p>
 * The actual change in font rendering behavior resulting from a call
 * to this method is implementation dependent; it may have no effect at
 * all, or the requested behavior may already match the default behavior.
 * The behavior may differ between font rendering in lightweight
 * and peered components.  Since calling this method requests a
 * different font, clients should expect different metrics, and may need
 * to recalculate window sizes and layout. Therefore this method should
 * be called before user interface initialisation.
 * @since 1.5
