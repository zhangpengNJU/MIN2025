/**
 * Returns an extended key code for the event.

 * current keyboard layout. For instance, pressing the left topmost letter key
 * in a common English layout produces the same value as {@code keyCode}, {@code VK_Q}.
 * Pressing the same key in a regular Russian layout gives another code, unique for the
 * letter "Cyrillic I short".
