 * settings.
 *
 * @param      u   the URL that this connects to.
 * @param      p   the proxy through which the connection will be made.
 *                 If direct connection is desired, Proxy.NO_PROXY
 *                 should be specified.
 * @return     a {@code URLConnection} object for the {@code URL}.
 * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs while opening the
 *               connection.
 * @exception  IllegalArgumentException if either u or p is null,
 *               or p has the wrong type.
 * @exception  UnsupportedOperationException if the subclass that
 *               implements the protocol doesn't support this method.
