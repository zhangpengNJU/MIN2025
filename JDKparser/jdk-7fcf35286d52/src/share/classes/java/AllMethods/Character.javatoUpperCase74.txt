/**
 * Converts the character (Unicode code point) argument to

 * <p>Note that
 * {@code Character.isUpperCase(Character.toUpperCase(codePoint))}
 * does not always return {@code true} for some ranges of
 * characters, particularly those that are symbols or ideographs.
 *
 * <p>In general, {@link String#toUpperCase()} should be used to map
 * characters to uppercase. {@code String} case mapping methods
 * have several benefits over {@code Character} case mapping methods.
 * {@code String} case mapping methods can perform locale-sensitive
 * mappings, context-sensitive mappings, and 1:M character mappings, whereas
 * the {@code Character} case mapping methods cannot.
 *
 * @param   codePoint   the character (Unicode code point) to be converted.
 * @return  the uppercase equivalent of the character, if any;
 *          otherwise, the character itself.
