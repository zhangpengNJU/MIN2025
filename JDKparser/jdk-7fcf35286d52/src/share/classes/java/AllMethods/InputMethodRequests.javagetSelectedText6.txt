/**
 * Gets the currently selected text from the text editing component.
 * This may be used for a variety of purposes.
 * One of them is the "Reconvert" feature in some input methods.
 * In this case, the input method will typically send an input method event
 * to replace the selected text with composed text. Depending on the input
 * method's capabilities, this may be the original composed text for the
 * selected text, the latest composed text entered anywhere in the text, or
 * a version of the text that's converted back from the selected text.
 *
 * <p>
 * The input method may provide a list of attributes that it is
 * interested in. In that case, information about other attributes that
 * the implementor may have need not be made accessible through the
 * iterator. If the list is null, all available attribute information
 * should be made accessible.
 *
 * @param attributes a list of attributes that the input method is
 * interested in
 * @return the currently selected text
