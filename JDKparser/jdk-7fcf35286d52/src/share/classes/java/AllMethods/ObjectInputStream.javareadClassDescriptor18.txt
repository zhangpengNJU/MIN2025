/**
 * Read a class descriptor from the serialization stream.  This method is

 * item in the serialization stream.  Subclasses of ObjectInputStream may
 * override this method to read in class descriptors that have been written
 * in non-standard formats (by subclasses of ObjectOutputStream which have
 * overridden the <code>writeClassDescriptor</code> method).  By default,
 * this method reads class descriptors according to the format defined in
 * the Object Serialization specification.
 *
 * @return  the class descriptor read
 * @throws  IOException If an I/O error has occurred.
 * @throws  ClassNotFoundException If the Class of a serialized object used
 *          in the class descriptor representation cannot be found
