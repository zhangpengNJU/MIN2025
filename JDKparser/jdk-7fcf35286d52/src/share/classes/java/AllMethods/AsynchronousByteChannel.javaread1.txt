/**
 * Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.
 *
 * <p> This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
 * sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The method
 * behaves in exactly the same manner as the {@link
 * #read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)
 * read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)} method except that instead
 * of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a {@code Future}
 * representing the pending result. The {@code Future}'s {@link Future#get()
 * get} method returns the number of bytes read or {@code -1} if no bytes
 * could be read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.
 *
 * @param   dst
 *          The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
 *
 * @return  A Future representing the result of the operation
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the buffer is read-only
 * @throws  ReadPendingException
 *          If the channel does not allow more than one read to be outstanding
 *          and a previous read has not completed
