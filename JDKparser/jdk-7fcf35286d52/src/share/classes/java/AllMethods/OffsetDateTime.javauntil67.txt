/**
 * Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.
 * <p>
 * This calculates the amount of time between two {@code OffsetDateTime}
 * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date-time.
 * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 * For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
 * using {@code startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 * {@code OffsetDateTime} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
 * If the offset differs between the two date-times, the specified
 * end date-time is normalized to have the same offset as this date-time.
 * <p>
 * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 * complete units between the two date-times.
 * For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
 * will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
 * <p>
 * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 * The first is to invoke this method.
 * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent
 *   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
 *   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 * </pre>
 * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 * <p>
 * The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 * The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
 * {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS}, {@code DAYS},
 * {@code WEEKS}, {@code MONTHS}, {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES},
 * {@code CENTURIES}, {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
 * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 * <p>
 * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 * as the second argument.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param endExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an {@code OffsetDateTime}, not null
 * @param unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null
 * @return the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time
 * @throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
 *  temporal cannot be converted to an {@code OffsetDateTime}
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
