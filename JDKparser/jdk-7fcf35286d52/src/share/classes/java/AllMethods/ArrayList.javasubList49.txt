/**
 * Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified
 * {@code fromIndex}, inclusive, and {@code toIndex}, exclusive.  (If
 * {@code fromIndex} and {@code toIndex} are equal, the returned list is
 * empty.)  The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural
 * changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa.
 * The returned list supports all of the optional list operations.
 *
 * <p>This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
 * the sort that commonly exist for arrays).  Any operation that expects
 * a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view
 * instead of a whole list.  For example, the following idiom
 * removes a range of elements from a list:
 * <pre>
 *      list.subList(from, to).clear();
 * </pre>
 * Similar idioms may be constructed for {@link #indexOf(Object)} and
 * {@link #lastIndexOf(Object)}, and all of the algorithms in the
 * {@link Collections} class can be applied to a subList.
 *
 * <p>The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if
 * the backing list (i.e., this list) is <i>structurally modified</i> in
 * any way other than via the returned list.  (Structural modifications are
 * those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such
 * a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)
