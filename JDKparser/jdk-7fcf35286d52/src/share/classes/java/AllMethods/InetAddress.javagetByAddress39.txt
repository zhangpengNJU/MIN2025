/**
 * Creates an InetAddress based on the provided host name and IP address.
 * No name service is checked for the validity of the address.
 *
 * <p> The host name can either be a machine name, such as
 * "{@code java.sun.com}", or a textual representation of its IP
 * address.
 * <p> No validity checking is done on the host name either.
 *
 * <p> If addr specifies an IPv4 address an instance of Inet4Address
 * will be returned; otherwise, an instance of Inet6Address
 * will be returned.
 *
 * <p> IPv4 address byte array must be 4 bytes long and IPv6 byte array
 * must be 16 bytes long
 *
 * @param host the specified host
 * @param addr the raw IP address in network byte order
 * @return  an InetAddress object created from the raw IP address.
 * @exception  UnknownHostException  if IP address is of illegal length
