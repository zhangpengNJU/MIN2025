/**
 * Returns the floating-point value adjacent to {@code d} in

 * semantically equivalent to {@code nextAfter(d,
 * Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY)}; however, a
 * {@code nextDown} implementation may run faster than its
 * equivalent {@code nextAfter} call.
 *
 * <p>Special Cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
 *
 * <li> If the argument is negative infinity, the result is
 * negative infinity.
 *
 * <li> If the argument is zero, the result is
 * {@code -Double.MIN_VALUE}
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param d  starting floating-point value
 * @return The adjacent floating-point value closer to negative
 * infinity.
