/**
 * Returns a {@code double} value with a positive sign, greater
 * than or equal to {@code 0.0} and less than {@code 1.0}.
 * Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately)
 * uniform distribution from that range.
 *
 * <p>When this method is first called, it creates a single new
 * pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression
 *
 * <blockquote>{@code new java.util.Random()}</blockquote>
 *
 * This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for
 * all calls to this method and is used nowhere else.
 *
 * <p>This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
 * more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
 * pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
 * for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.
 *
 * @return  a pseudorandom {@code double} greater than or equal
 * to {@code 0.0} and less than {@code 1.0}.
 * @see Random#nextDouble()
