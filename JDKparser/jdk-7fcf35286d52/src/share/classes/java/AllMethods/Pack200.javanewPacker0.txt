// Static methods of the Pack200 class.
/**
 * Obtain new instance of a class that implements Packer.
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>If the system property <tt>java.util.jar.Pack200.Packer</tt>
 * is defined, then the value is taken to be the fully-qualified name
 * of a concrete implementation class, which must implement Packer.
 * This class is loaded and instantiated.  If this process fails
 * then an unspecified error is thrown.</p></li>
 *
 * <li><p>If an implementation has not been specified with the system
 * property, then the system-default implementation class is instantiated,
 * and the result is returned.</p></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note:  The returned object is not guaranteed to operate
 * correctly if multiple threads use it at the same time.
 * A multi-threaded application should either allocate multiple
 * packer engines, or else serialize use of one engine with a lock.
 *
 * @return  A newly allocated Packer engine.
