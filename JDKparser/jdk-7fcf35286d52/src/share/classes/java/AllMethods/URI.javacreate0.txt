/**
 * Creates a URI by parsing the given string.
 *
 * <p> This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the {@link
 * #URI(String)} constructor; any {@link URISyntaxException} thrown by the
 * constructor is caught and wrapped in a new {@link
 * IllegalArgumentException} object, which is then thrown.
 *
 * <p> This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that
 * the given string is a legal URI, for example for URI constants declared
 * within in a program, and so it would be considered a programming error
 * for the string not to parse as such.  The constructors, which throw
 * {@link URISyntaxException} directly, should be used situations where a
 * URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
 * may be prone to errors.  </p>
 *
 * @param  str   The string to be parsed into a URI
 * @return The new URI
 *
 * @throws  NullPointerException
 *          If {@code str} is {@code null}
 *
 * @throws  IllegalArgumentException
 *          If the given string violates RFC&nbsp;2396
