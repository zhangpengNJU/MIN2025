/**
 * Combine the components for the delivered byte pixels into the

 * pixels that are complete.  If the correct hints were not
 * specified in the setHints call then relay the work to our
 * superclass which is capable of scaling pixels regardless of
 * the delivery hints.
 * <p>
 * Note: This method is intended to be called by the
 * <code>ImageProducer</code> of the <code>Image</code>
 * whose pixels are being filtered.  Developers using
 * this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
 * this method directly since that operation could interfere
 * with the filtering operation.
