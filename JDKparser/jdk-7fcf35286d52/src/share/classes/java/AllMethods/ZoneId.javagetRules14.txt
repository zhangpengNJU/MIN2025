/**
 * Gets the time-zone rules for this ID allowing calculations to be performed.
 * <p>
 * The rules provide the functionality associated with a time-zone,
 * such as finding the offset for a given instant or local date-time.
 * <p>
 * A time-zone can be invalid if it is deserialized in a Java Runtime which
 * does not have the same rules loaded as the Java Runtime that stored it.
 * In this case, calling this method will throw a {@code ZoneRulesException}.
 * <p>
 * The rules are supplied by {@link ZoneRulesProvider}. An advanced provider may
 * support dynamic updates to the rules without restarting the Java Runtime.
 * If so, then the result of this method may change over time.
 * Each individual call will be still remain thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * {@link ZoneOffset} will always return a set of rules where the offset never changes.
 *
 * @return the rules, not null
 * @throws ZoneRulesException if no rules are available for this ID
