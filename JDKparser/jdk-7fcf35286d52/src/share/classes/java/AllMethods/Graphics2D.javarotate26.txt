/**
 * Concatenates the current <code>Graphics2D</code>
 * <code>Transform</code> with a translated rotation
 * transform.  Subsequent rendering is transformed by a transform
 * which is constructed by translating to the specified location,
 * rotating by the specified radians, and translating back by the same
 * amount as the original translation.  This is equivalent to the
 * following sequence of calls:
 * <pre>
 *          translate(x, y);
 *          rotate(theta);
 *          translate(-x, -y);
 * </pre>
 * Rotating with a positive angle theta rotates points on the positive
 * x axis toward the positive y axis.
 * @param theta the angle of rotation in radians
 * @param x the x coordinate of the origin of the rotation
 * @param y the y coordinate of the origin of the rotation
