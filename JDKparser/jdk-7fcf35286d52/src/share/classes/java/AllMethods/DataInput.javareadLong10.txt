/**
 * Reads eight input bytes and returns
 * a {@code long} value. Let {@code a-h}
 * be the first through eighth bytes read.
 * The value returned is:
 * <pre>{@code
 * (((long)(a & 0xff) << 56) |
 *  ((long)(b & 0xff) << 48) |
 *  ((long)(c & 0xff) << 40) |

 *  ((long)(g & 0xff) <<  8) |
 *  ((long)(h & 0xff)))
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * This method is suitable
 * for reading bytes written by the {@code writeLong}

 *
 * @return     the {@code long} value read.
 * @exception  EOFException  if this stream reaches the end before reading
 *               all the bytes.
 * @exception  IOException   if an I/O error occurs.
