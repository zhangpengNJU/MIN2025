/**
 * Returns the {@code int} value that the specified Unicode
 * character represents. For example, the character
 * {@code '\u005Cu216C'} (the roman numeral fifty) will return
 * an int with a value of 50.
 * <p>
 * The letters A-Z in their uppercase ({@code '\u005Cu0041'} through
 * {@code '\u005Cu005A'}), lowercase
 * ({@code '\u005Cu0061'} through {@code '\u005Cu007A'}), and
 * full width variant ({@code '\u005CuFF21'} through
 * {@code '\u005CuFF3A'} and {@code '\u005CuFF41'} through
 * {@code '\u005CuFF5A'}) forms have numeric values from 10
 * through 35. This is independent of the Unicode specification,
 * which does not assign numeric values to these {@code char}
 * values.
 * <p>
 * If the character does not have a numeric value, then -1 is returned.
 * If the character has a numeric value that cannot be represented as a
 * nonnegative integer (for example, a fractional value), then -2
 * is returned.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This method cannot handle <a
 * href="#supplementary"> supplementary characters</a>. To support
 * all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
 * the {@link #getNumericValue(int)} method.
 *
 * @param   ch      the character to be converted.
 * @return  the numeric value of the character, as a nonnegative {@code int}
 *           value; -2 if the character has a numeric value that is not a
 *          nonnegative integer; -1 if the character has no numeric value.
 * @see     Character#forDigit(int, int)
