 * Gets the range of valid values for the field.
 * <p>
 * All fields can be expressed as a {@code long} integer.
 * This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.
 * <p>
 * This method returns the range of the field in the ISO-8601 calendar system.
 * This range may be incorrect for other calendar systems.
 * Use {@link Chronology#range(ChronoField)} to access the correct range
 * for a different calendar system.
 * <p>
 * Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
 * and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
 * could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.
