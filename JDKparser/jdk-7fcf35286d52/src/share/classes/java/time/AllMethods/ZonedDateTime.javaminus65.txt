/**
 * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.
 * <p>
 * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the amount
 * in terms of the unit subtracted. If it is not possible to subtract the amount,
 * because the unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 * <p>
 * The calculation for date and time units differ.
 * <p>
 * Date units operate on the local time-line.
 * The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back
 * to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
 * The conversion uses {@link #ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)}
 * with the offset before the subtraction.
 * <p>
 * Time units operate on the instant time-line.
 * The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back to
 * a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
 * The conversion uses {@link #ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)}
 * with the offset before the subtraction.
 * <p>
 * This method is equivalent to {@link #plus(long, TemporalUnit)} with the amount negated.
 * See that method for a full description of how addition, and thus subtraction, works.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param amountToSubtract  the amount of the unit to subtract from the result, may be negative
 * @param unit  the unit of the amount to subtract, not null
 * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the specified amount subtracted, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the subtraction cannot be made
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
