/**
 * Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified period added.
 * <p>
 * This method returns a new object based on this one with the specified period added.
 * For example, on a {@code LocalDate}, this could be used to add a number of years, months or days.
 * The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.
 * <p>
 * In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
 * a date representing the 31st January, then adding one month would be unclear.
 * In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the result. Typically it will choose
 * the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * Implementations must check and handle all units defined in {@link ChronoUnit}.
 * If the unit is supported, then the addition must be performed.
 * If unsupported, then an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} must be thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
 * passing {@code this} as the first argument.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must not alter this object.
 * Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
 * This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.
 *
 * @param amountToAdd  the amount of the specified unit to add, may be negative
 * @param unit  the unit of the amount to add, not null
 * @return an object of the same type with the specified period added, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the unit cannot be added
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
