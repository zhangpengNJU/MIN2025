/**
 *  Obtains an instance of {@code ZonedDateTime} from a local date-time.
 *  <p>
 *  This creates a zoned date-time matching the input local date-time as closely as possible.
 *  Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
 *  is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.
 *  <p>
 *  The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
 *  This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
 *  date-time as defined by the {@link ZoneRules rules} of the zone ID.
 * <p>
 *  In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
 *  In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
 *  This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".
 *  <p>
 *  In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
 *  Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
 *  For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
 *  moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".
 *
 *  @param localDateTime  the local date-time, not null
 *  @param zone  the time-zone, not null
 *  @return the zoned date-time, not null
