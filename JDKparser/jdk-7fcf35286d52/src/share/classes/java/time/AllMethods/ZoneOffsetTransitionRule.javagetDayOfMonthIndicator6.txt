/**
 * Gets the indicator of the day-of-month of the transition.
 * <p>
 * If the rule defines an exact date then the day is the month of that date.
 * <p>
 * If the rule defines a week where the transition might occur, then the day
 * defines either the start of the end of the transition week.
 * <p>
 * If the value is positive, then it represents a normal day-of-month, and is the
 * earliest possible date that the transition can be.
 * The date may refer to 29th February which should be treated as 1st March in non-leap years.
 * <p>
 * If the value is negative, then it represents the number of days back from the
 * end of the month where {@code -1} is the last day of the month.
 * In this case, the day identified is the latest possible date that the transition can be.
 *
 * @return the day-of-month indicator, from -28 to 31 excluding 0
