/**
 * Gets the era applicable at this date.
 * <p>
 * The official ISO-8601 standard does not define eras, however {@code IsoChronology} does.
 * It defines two eras, 'CE' from year one onwards and 'BCE' from year zero backwards.
 * Since dates before the Julian-Gregorian cutover are not in line with history,
 * the cutover between 'BCE' and 'CE' is also not aligned with the commonly used
 * eras, often referred to using 'BC' and 'AD'.
 * <p>
 * Users of this class should typically ignore this method as it exists primarily
 * to fulfill the {@link ChronoLocalDate} contract where it is necessary to support
 * the Japanese calendar system.
 * <p>
 * The returned era will be a singleton capable of being compared with the constants
 * in {@link IsoChronology} using the {@code ==} operator.
 *
 * @return the {@code IsoChronology} era constant applicable at this date, not null
