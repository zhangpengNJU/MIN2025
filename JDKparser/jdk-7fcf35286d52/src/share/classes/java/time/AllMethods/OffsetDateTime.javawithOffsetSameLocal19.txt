/**
 * Returns a copy of this {@code OffsetDateTime} with the specified offset ensuring
 * that the result has the same local date-time.
 * <p>
 * This method returns an object with the same {@code LocalDateTime} and the specified {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * No calculation is needed or performed.
 * For example, if this time represents {@code 2007-12-03T10:30+02:00} and the offset specified is
 * {@code +03:00}, then this method will return {@code 2007-12-03T10:30+03:00}.
 * <p>
 * To take into account the difference between the offsets, and adjust the time fields,
 * use {@link #withOffsetSameInstant}.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param offset  the zone offset to change to, not null
 * @return an {@code OffsetDateTime} based on this date-time with the requested offset, not null
