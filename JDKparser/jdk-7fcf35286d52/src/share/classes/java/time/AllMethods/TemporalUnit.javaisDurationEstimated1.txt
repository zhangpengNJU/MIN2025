/**
 * Checks if the duration of the unit is an estimate.
 * <p>
 * All units have a duration, however the duration is not always accurate.
 * For example, days have an estimated duration due to the possibility of
 * daylight saving time changes.
 * This method returns true if the duration is an estimate and false if it is
 * accurate. Note that accurate/estimated ignores leap seconds.
 *
 * @return true if the duration is estimated, false if accurate
