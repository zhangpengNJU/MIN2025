/**
 * Returns an adjusted copy of this date.
 * <p>
 * This returns a {@code LocalDate}, based on this one, with the date adjusted.
 * The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 * Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 * <p>
 * A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 * A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 * <p>
 * A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 * {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
 * These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 * Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
 * such as {@link Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
 * The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 * lengths of month and leap years.
 * <p>
 * For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 * <pre>
 *  import static java.time.Month.*;
 *  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;
 *
 *  result = localDate.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 * {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
 * specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param adjuster the adjuster to use, not null
 * @return a {@code LocalDate} based on {@code this} with the adjustment made, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the adjustment cannot be made
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
