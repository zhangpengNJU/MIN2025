/**
 * Appends the time-zone name, such as 'British Summer Time', to the formatter.
 * <p>
 * This appends an instruction to format/parse the textual name of the zone to
 * the builder.
 * <p>
 * During formatting, the zone is obtained using a mechanism equivalent
 * to querying the temporal with {@link TemporalQueries#zoneId()}.
 * If the zone is a {@code ZoneOffset} it will be printed using the
 * result of {@link ZoneOffset#getId()}.
 * If the zone is not an offset, the textual name will be looked up
 * for the locale set in the {@link DateTimeFormatter}.
 * If the temporal object being printed represents an instant, then the text
 * will be the summer or winter time text as appropriate.
 * If the lookup for text does not find any suitable result, then the
 * {@link ZoneId#getId() ID} will be printed instead.
 * If the zone cannot be obtained then an exception is thrown unless the
 * section of the formatter is optional.
 * <p>
 * During parsing, either the textual zone name, the zone ID or the offset
 * is accepted. Many textual zone names are not unique, such as CST can be
 * for both "Central Standard Time" and "China Standard Time". In this
 * situation, the zone id will be determined by the region information from
 * formatter's  {@link DateTimeFormatter#getLocale() locale} and the standard
 * zone id for that area, for example, America/New_York for the America Eastern
 * zone. This method also allows a set of preferred {@link ZoneId} to be
 * specified for parsing. The matched preferred zone id will be used if the
 * textural zone name being parsed is not unique.
 * <p>
 * If the zone cannot be parsed then an exception is thrown unless the
 * section of the formatter is optional.
 *
 * @param textStyle  the text style to use, not null
 * @param preferredZones  the set of preferred zone ids, not null
 * @return this, for chaining, not null
