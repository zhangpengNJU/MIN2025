/**
 * Adds to the specified temporal object.
 * <p>
 * Adds the amount to the specified temporal object using the logic
 * encapsulated in the implementing class.
 * <p>
 * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 * The first is to invoke this method directly.
 * The second is to use {@link Temporal#plus(TemporalAmount)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // These two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   dateTime = amount.addTo(dateTime);
 *   dateTime = dateTime.plus(adder);
 * </pre>
 * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code plus(TemporalAmount)},
 * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * The implementation must take the input object and add to it.
 * The implementation defines the logic of the addition and is responsible for
 * documenting that logic. It may use any method on {@code Temporal} to
 * query the temporal object and perform the addition.
 * The returned object must have the same observable type as the input object
 * <p>
 * The input object must not be altered.
 * Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
 * This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable temporal objects.
 * <p>
 * The input temporal object may be in a calendar system other than ISO.
 * Implementations may choose to document compatibility with other calendar systems,
 * or reject non-ISO temporal objects by {@link TemporalQueries#chronology() querying the chronology}.
 * <p>
 * This method may be called from multiple threads in parallel.
 * It must be thread-safe when invoked.
 *
 * @param temporal  the temporal object to add the amount to, not null
 * @return an object of the same observable type with the addition made, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if unable to add
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
