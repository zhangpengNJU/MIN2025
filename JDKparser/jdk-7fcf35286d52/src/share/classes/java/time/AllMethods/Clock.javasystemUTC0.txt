/**
 * Obtains a clock that returns the current instant using the best available

 * This clock, rather than {@link #systemDefaultZone()}, should be used when
 * you need the current instant without the date or time.
 * <p>
 * This clock is based on the best available system clock.
 * This may use {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, or a higher resolution
 * clock if one is available.
 * <p>
 * Conversion from instant to date or time uses the {@linkplain ZoneOffset#UTC UTC time-zone}.
 * <p>
 * The returned implementation is immutable, thread-safe and {@code Serializable}.
 * It is equivalent to {@code system(ZoneOffset.UTC)}.
 *
 * @return a clock that uses the best available system clock in the UTC zone, not null
