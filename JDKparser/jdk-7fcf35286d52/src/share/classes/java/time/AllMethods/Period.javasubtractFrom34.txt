/**
 * Subtracts this period from the specified temporal object.
 * <p>
 * This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
 * with this period subtracted.
 * If the temporal has a chronology, it must be the ISO chronology.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
 * {@link Temporal#minus(TemporalAmount)}.
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   dateTime = thisPeriod.subtractFrom(dateTime);
 *   dateTime = dateTime.minus(thisPeriod);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The calculation operates as follows.
 * First, the chronology of the temporal is checked to ensure it is ISO chronology or null.
 * Second, if the months are zero, the years are subtracted if non-zero, otherwise
 * the combination of years and months is subtracted if non-zero.
 * Finally, any days are subtracted.
 * <p>
 * This approach ensures that a partial period can be subtracted from a partial date.
 * For example, a period of years and/or months can be subtracted from a {@code YearMonth},
 * but a period including days cannot.
 * The approach also subtracts years and months together when necessary, which ensures
 * correct behaviour at the end of the month.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param temporal  the temporal object to adjust, not null
 * @return an object of the same type with the adjustment made, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if unable to subtract
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
