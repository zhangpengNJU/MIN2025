/**
 * Returns a copy of this time with the specified amount added.
 * <p>
 * This returns a {@code LocalTime}, based on this one, with the amount
 * in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
 * unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the field is a {@link ChronoUnit} then the addition is implemented here.
 * The supported fields behave as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code NANOS} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of nanoseconds added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusNanos(long)}.
 * <li>{@code MICROS} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of microseconds added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusNanos(long)} with the amount
 *  multiplied by 1,000.
 * <li>{@code MILLIS} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of milliseconds added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusNanos(long)} with the amount
 *  multiplied by 1,000,000.
 * <li>{@code SECONDS} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of seconds added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusSeconds(long)}.
 * <li>{@code MINUTES} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of minutes added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusMinutes(long)}.
 * <li>{@code HOURS} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of hours added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusHours(long)}.
 * <li>{@code HALF_DAYS} -
 *  Returns a {@code LocalTime} with the specified number of half-days added.
 *  This is equivalent to {@link #plusHours(long)} with the amount
 *  multiplied by 12.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All other {@code ChronoUnit} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
 * <p>
 * If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
 * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
 * whether and how to perform the addition.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param amountToAdd  the amount of the unit to add to the result, may be negative
 * @param unit  the unit of the amount to add, not null
 * @return a {@code LocalTime} based on this time with the specified amount added, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the addition cannot be made
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
