/**
 * Returns the last in month adjuster, which returns a new date
 * in the same month with the last matching day-of-week.
 * This is used for expressions like 'last Tuesday in March'.
 * <p>
 * The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:<br>
 * The input 2011-12-15 for (MONDAY) will return 2011-12-26.<br>
 * The input 2011-12-15 for (FRIDAY) will return 2011-12-30.<br>
 * <p>
 * The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
 * It uses the {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} fields
 * and the {@code DAYS} unit, and assumes a seven day week.
 *
 * @param dayOfWeek  the day-of-week, not null
 * @return the first in month adjuster, not null
