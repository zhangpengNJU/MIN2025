/**
 * Gets the value of the specified field from this time as an {@code int}.
 * <p>
 * This queries this time for the value of the specified field.
 * The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
 * If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
 * or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the query is implemented here.
 * The {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will return valid
 * values based on this time, except {@code NANO_OF_DAY} and {@code MICRO_OF_DAY}
 * which are too large to fit in an {@code int} and throw a {@code DateTimeException}.
 * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
 * <p>
 * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
 * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)}
 * passing {@code this} as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
 * and what the value represents, is determined by the field.
 *
 * @param field  the field to get, not null
 * @return the value for the field
 * @throws DateTimeException if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
 *         the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the field is not supported or
 *         the range of values exceeds an {@code int}
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
