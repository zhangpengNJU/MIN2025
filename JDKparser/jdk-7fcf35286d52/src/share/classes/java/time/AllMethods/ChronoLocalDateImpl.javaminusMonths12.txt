/**
 * Returns a copy of this date with the specified number of months subtracted.

 * In some cases, subtracting months can cause the resulting date to become invalid.
 * If this occurs, then other fields, typically the day-of-month, will be adjusted to ensure
 * that the result is valid. Typically this will select the last valid day of the month.

 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

 * @param monthsToSubtract  the months to subtract, may be negative
 * @return a date based on this one with the months subtracted, not null
