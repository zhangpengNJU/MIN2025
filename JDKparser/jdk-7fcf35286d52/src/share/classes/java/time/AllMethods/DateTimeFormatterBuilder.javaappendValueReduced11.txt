/**
 * Appends the reduced value of a date-time field to the formatter.
 * <p>
 * This is typically used for formatting and parsing a two digit year.
 * <p>
 * The base date is used to calculate the full value during parsing.
 * For example, if the base date is 1950-01-01 then parsed values for
 * a two digit year parse will be in the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
 * Only the year would be extracted from the date, thus a base date of
 * 1950-08-25 would also parse to the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
 * This behavior is necessary to support fields such as week-based-year
 * or other calendar systems where the parsed value does not align with
 * standard ISO years.
 * <p>
 * The exact behavior is as follows. Parse the full set of fields and
 * determine the effective chronology using the last chronology if
 * it appears more than once. Then convert the base date to the
 * effective chronology. Then extract the specified field from the
 * chronology-specific base date and use it to determine the
 * {@code baseValue} used below.
 * <p>
 * For formatting, the {@code width} and {@code maxWidth} are used to
 * determine the number of characters to format.
 * If they are equal then the format is fixed width.
 * If the value of the field is within the range of the {@code baseValue} using
 * {@code width} characters then the reduced value is formatted otherwise the value is
 * truncated to fit {@code maxWidth}.
 * The rightmost characters are output to match the width, left padding with zero.
 * <p>
 * For strict parsing, the number of characters allowed by {@code width} to {@code maxWidth} are parsed.
 * For lenient parsing, the number of characters must be at least 1 and less than 10.
 * If the number of digits parsed is equal to {@code width} and the value is positive,
 * the value of the field is computed to be the first number greater than
 * or equal to the {@code baseValue} with the same least significant characters,
 * otherwise the value parsed is the field value.
 * This allows a reduced value to be entered for values in range of the baseValue
 * and width and absolute values can be entered for values outside the range.
 * <p>
 * For example, a base value of {@code 1980} and a width of {@code 2} will have
 * valid values from {@code 1980} to {@code 2079}.
 * During parsing, the text {@code "12"} will result in the value {@code 2012} as that
 * is the value within the range where the last two characters are "12".
 * By contrast, parsing the text {@code "1915"} will result in the value {@code 1915}.
 *
 * @param field  the field to append, not null
 * @param width  the field width of the printed and parsed field, from 1 to 10
 * @param maxWidth  the maximum field width of the printed field, from 1 to 10
 * @param baseDate  the base date used to calculate the base value for the range
 *  of valid values in the parsed chronology, not null
 * @return this, for chaining, not null
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the width or base value is invalid
