/**
 * Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,

 * This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
 * This normally results in a change to the local date-time.
 * <p>
 * This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
 * in the local time-line have no effect on the result.
 * <p>
 * To change the offset while keeping the local time,
 * use {@link #withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)}.
 *
 * @param zone  the time-zone to change to, not null
 * @return a {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the result exceeds the supported date range
