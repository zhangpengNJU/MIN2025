 * Changes the parse style to be lenient for the remainder of the formatter.
 * Note that case sensitivity is set separately to this method.
 * <p>
 * Parsing can be strict or lenient - by default its strict.
 * This controls the degree of flexibility in matching the text and sign styles.
 * Applications calling this method should typically also call {@link #parseCaseInsensitive()}.
 * <p>
 * When used, this method changes the parsing to be lenient from this point onwards.
 * The change will remain in force until the end of the formatter that is eventually
 * constructed or until {@code parseStrict} is called.
 *
 * @return this, for chaining, not null
