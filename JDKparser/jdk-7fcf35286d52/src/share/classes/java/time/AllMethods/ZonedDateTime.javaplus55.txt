/**
 * Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount added.
 * <p>
 * This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the amount
 * in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
 * unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the field is a {@link ChronoUnit} then the addition is implemented here.
 * The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.
 * The calculation for date and time units differ.
 * <p>
 * Date units operate on the local time-line.
 * The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back
 * to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
 * The conversion uses {@link #ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)}
 * with the offset before the addition.
 * <p>
 * Time units operate on the instant time-line.
 * The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back to
 * a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
 * The conversion uses {@link #ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)}
 * with the offset before the addition.
 * <p>
 * If the field is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)}
 * passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
 * whether and how to perform the addition.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param amountToAdd  the amount of the unit to add to the result, may be negative
 * @param unit  the unit of the amount to add, not null
 * @return a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the specified amount added, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the addition cannot be made
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
