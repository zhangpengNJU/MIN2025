 * When converting back to {@code ZonedDateTime}, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
 * then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
 * If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
