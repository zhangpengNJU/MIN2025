/**
 * Checks if this field is supported by the temporal object.
 * <p>
 * This determines whether the temporal accessor supports this field.
 * If this returns false, then the temporal cannot be queried for this field.
 * <p>
 * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 * The first is to invoke this method directly.
 * The second is to use {@link TemporalAccessor#isSupported(TemporalField)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   temporal = thisField.isSupportedBy(temporal);
 *   temporal = temporal.isSupported(thisField);
 * </pre>
 * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code isSupported(TemporalField)},
 * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should determine whether they are supported using the fields
 * available in {@link ChronoField}.
 *
 * @param temporal  the temporal object to query, not null
 * @return true if the date-time can be queried for this field, false if not
