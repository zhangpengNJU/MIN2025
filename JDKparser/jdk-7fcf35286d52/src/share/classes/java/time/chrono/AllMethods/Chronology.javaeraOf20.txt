/**
 * Creates the chronology era object from the numeric value.
 * <p>
 * The era is, conceptually, the largest division of the time-line.
 * Most calendar systems have a single epoch dividing the time-line into two eras.
 * However, some have multiple eras, such as one for the reign of each leader.
 * The exact meaning is determined by the chronology according to the following constraints.
 * <p>
 * The era in use at 1970-01-01 must have the value 1.
 * Later eras must have sequentially higher values.
 * Earlier eras must have sequentially lower values.
 * Each chronology must refer to an enum or similar singleton to provide the era values.
 * <p>
 * This method returns the singleton era of the correct type for the specified era value.
 *
 * @param eraValue  the era value
 * @return the calendar system era, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if unable to create the era
