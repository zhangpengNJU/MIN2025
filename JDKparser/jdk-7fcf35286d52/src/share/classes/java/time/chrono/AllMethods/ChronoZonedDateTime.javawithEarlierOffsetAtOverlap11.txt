/**
 * Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the

 * This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
 * at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
 * valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
 * a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.
 * <p>
 * If this method is called when it is not an overlap, {@code this}
 * is returned.
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

 * @return a {@code ChronoZonedDateTime} based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if no rules can be found for the zone
 * @throws DateTimeException if no rules are valid for this date-time
