/**
 * Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same date as this object.
 * <p>
 * This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
 * with the date changed to be the same as this.
 * <p>
 * The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
 * passing {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY} as the field.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
 * {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   temporal = thisLocalDate.adjustInto(temporal);
 *   temporal = temporal.with(thisLocalDate);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
 *
 * @param temporal  the target object to be adjusted, not null
 * @return the adjusted object, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if unable to make the adjustment
 * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
