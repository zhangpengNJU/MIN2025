/**
 * Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.
 * <p>
 * The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
 * This era is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
 * If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
 * or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 * <p>
 * If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the query is implemented here.
 * The {@code ERA} field returns the range.
 * All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
 * <p>
 * If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
 * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)}
 * passing {@code this} as the argument.
 * Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation must return a range for {@code ERA} from
 * zero to one, suitable for two era calendar systems such as ISO.
 *
 * @param field  the field to query the range for, not null
 * @return the range of valid values for the field, not null
 * @throws DateTimeException if the range for the field cannot be obtained
 * @throws UnsupportedTemporalTypeException if the unit is not supported
