/**
 * An activation group calls its monitor's
 * <code>inactiveObject</code> method when an object in its group
 * becomes inactive (deactivates).  An activation group discovers
 * that an object (that it participated in activating) in its VM
 * is no longer active, via calls to the activation group's
 * <code>inactiveObject</code> method. <p>
 *
 * The <code>inactiveObject</code> call informs the
 * <code>ActivationMonitor</code> that the remote object reference
 * it holds for the object with the activation identifier,
 * <code>id</code>, is no longer valid. The monitor considers the
 * reference associated with <code>id</code> as a stale reference.
 * Since the reference is considered stale, a subsequent
 * <code>activate</code> call for the same activation identifier
 * results in re-activating the remote object.<p>
 *
 * @param id the object's activation identifier
 * @exception UnknownObjectException if object is unknown
 * @exception RemoteException if remote call fails
