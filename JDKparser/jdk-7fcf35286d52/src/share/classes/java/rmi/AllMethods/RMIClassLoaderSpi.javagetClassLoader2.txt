/**
 * Provides the implementation for
 * {@link RMIClassLoader#getClassLoader(String)}.
 *
 * Returns a class loader that loads classes from the given codebase
 * URL path.
 *
 * <p>If there is a security manger, its <code>checkPermission</code>
 * method will be invoked with a
 * <code>RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")</code> permission;
 * this could result in a <code>SecurityException</code>.
 * The implementation of this method may also perform further security
 * checks to verify that the calling context has permission to connect
 * to all of the URLs in the codebase URL path.
 *
 * @param   codebase the list of URLs (space-separated) from which
 * the returned class loader will load classes from, or <code>null</code>
 *
 * @return a class loader that loads classes from the given codebase URL
 * path
 *
 * @throws  MalformedURLException if <code>codebase</code> is
 * non-<code>null</code> and contains an invalid URL, or
 * if <code>codebase</code> is <code>null</code> and a provider-specific
 * URL used to identify the class loader is invalid
 *
 * @throws  SecurityException if there is a security manager and the
 * invocation of its <code>checkPermission</code> method fails, or
 * if the caller does not have permission to connect to all of the
 * URLs in the codebase URL path
