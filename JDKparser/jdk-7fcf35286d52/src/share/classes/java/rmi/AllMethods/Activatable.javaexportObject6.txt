 * Export the activatable remote object to the RMI runtime to make

 * During activation, this <code>exportObject</code> method should
 * be invoked explicitly by an "activatable" object, that does not
 * extend the <code>Activatable</code> class. There is no need for objects
 * that do extend the <code>Activatable</code> class to invoke this
 * method directly because the object is exported during construction.
 *
 * @return the stub for the activatable remote object
 * @param obj the remote object implementation
 * @param id the object's  activation identifier
 * @param port the port on which the object is exported (an anonymous
 * port is used if port=0)
 * @exception RemoteException if object export fails
 * @exception UnsupportedOperationException if and only if activation is
 * not supported by this implementation
